"Ad not available... It's getting old watching a 30 second video and then at the end it tells you ""Ad not available"" and no reward. I've been on the same level for awhile, I'll probably just uninstall and move on. Ok, this game is great, they do help you pass levels without paying. Problem now is, I've been playing a hard level and it took a while to pass. I finally passed, won the level. Now I'm stuck playing the level again. I don't want to deal with it again."
"I love this game very much. I love the colourful candies. Recently, the developer of the application changed the music and added new candies. Although, the new music is also good but the previous one was actually suitable for the game and it was perfect for this game. We wish if we get the options to switch to the previous music. We miss that music alot and hope one day we get it back again. What I don't like about this game is the presence of horse and cartoons with dark complexion."
"They have stopped ads for lives and extra moves if a level is not passed. Its making the game boring when we're stuck on same level for one week. Also, I'm not receiving any lives from friends since I last updated the app. If you want to force us in buying lives and goodies than its your mistake. I'll just uninstall it if you don't fix the problem and so will many others like me. Thanks in advance"

"I have been playing for a while and I wish some of the levels were made easier, especially the nightmare difficulty. It seems they are made impossible unless you spend money on boosters or extra moves. I don't feel that is right especially when its one after another back to back, and I did pay to pass the previous level.... Getting to the point when I will just delete the game and forget about it..."
"It's a fun,relaxing game that speaks to my sense of order and need to organize. The drawbacks are that after a certain level the game becomes competitive, even if it's just against yourself! Most of the levels require boosters to beat which you can win free but the temptation is there to buy. If you don't want to spend real money on a game then resign yourself to win the levels without boosters. Over all addictive and entertaining. If you find level too hard w/o $$...just start over!"
"I love this game... I have for years, but I hate when the option to watch a video for extra moves disappears... I don't know why it does that. It will appear for a long time, then just disappear for weeks... this makes it ridiculously hard to beat the levels without having to buy gold in order to continue playing. I'm debating on taking a break from it for a while."
"Keeps my attention and helps me focus and have fun. It's challenging, but not like some games where I'm stuck on one level for days because not enough lives and very aggravating when you get to a few hundred levels and then you get stuck and can't continue til you pass a level. But what if someone can't for some reason pass a level . Then I just give up the game that once was fun. But when it's to difficult after 30 plus tries, would be great to have a free pass somehow.. B 4 in other games."
"After spending some money on this in the past, I encountered some seemingly impossible levels around 450 and all the way to 530. After doing some research I found out that all of those levels have had move limits reduced by around 20%, e.g. a 20 move level is now limited to 16 moves. This renders most of the levels unwinnable without paid boosters or getting very lucky. It was fun while it lasted, I guess, but paying 5€ just to be able to advance a couple of levels is out of the question."
"Sometimes enjoyable, more often annoying. I actually spent some money on this when i first started playing but absolutely refuse to do so now. The fish ruin your set-ups and don't go for vital objects. And it's far too easy to accidentally use gold bars. It takes 3 or 4 confirmations to quit the game but touch the 'use gold bars' button and bam! Instant purchase."
"Good time consuming app. I have following issue since december: Although the candy crush sounds are turned off completely, when i start the game it pauses the music I am playing already in YouTube Music. Whenever a pop-up with music spears, it pauses the music again. Sometimes the cherry's are not dropping anymore, so you can't finish the level (especially when you remove the cherries very fast at beginning of the round)"
"The game is pretty good, although the latest update is a massive head scratcher. Why did you change the texture of the green candies?? It's so distracting and looks so out of place. It's hard for it to blend with other candy colours cause it sticks out like a sore thumb. I hope this texture change is temporary. I miss the old map for the levels too, the new one is admitted aesthetic, but maybe of we zoom out more, it would be as beneficial as the old map?"
"This is really fun! Resisted for years, but found it is one of the apps with fewer ads - however, there are daily/multiple daily requests to make in-app purchases, more than other games. (And, most petty, I don't like the animation.) But I'm having a lot of fun!"
"Not a free game. Its is set up to make you have to pay to continue playing. The rewards with the adds don't work when you need them for a few extra moves at the end of a level, as the exit x does not work and you watch ads for nothing. So unless you have bought gold bars you lose. It's funny how they ads only run into problems when you need it to work to pass a level and are given the only other alternative which is to spend money."
"Everything about this game is superb, buh my only issue is that I'm unable to watch ads, the ones that help add more moves after I've used up the allocated number of moves for a level. I used to be able to watch the ads but they have stopped, and I thought if I updated the app it would come back but it wasn't the case. Please help. It's making passing levels more difficult than should be."
"It's a great fun but sometimes it can be so frustrating and annoying especially when get stuck on the same level for the last 3 weeks. Keep updating this app but it feels like it's getting worse with every update. Would not recommend to waste your time, health and life on it to be honest. Also nothing really special about this app, all the same levels loop around. Thanks for your entertainment."
"Often when I get a color bomb, something like a booster candy comes up and automatically activates it before I get a chance to use it. My girlfriend has the beanstalk which I haven't had in months. I uninstalled and reinstalled and still nothing. They also took away the part where after so many points, levels you get boosters and at the end you would get something extra, no more of that. Way too many hard levels, one after another. Not fun anymore, will be uninstalling permanently."
Deleted the game at 474. didn't have any problems with the micro transactions. helped speed up the game. but on level 474 I had to drop cherries that would spawn at the top and drop them through the bottom. blasted absolutely everything away and went through every move without a single cherry dropping. passed it on the next attempt. then the next level I couldn't even get 50% through. it felt like it was trying to force me to make another transaction so I deleted the game.
"There are so many pop ups I have to click ""x"" like 10 times before I can even play a level. It also gets to a point where the game is unplayable unless you pay to complete levels or watch an endless amount of ads, only it seems watching ads for extra moves or boosters isn't even available anymore/on certain levels, and so you end up getting stuck on the same level for days on end. Gets so irritating playing the same level 20 times and then only winning by luck. Bored. Uninstalled."
"The ""upgrade"" is that they added more dumbass ads. When you finish a round you can get the option of watching an ad to get three more moves or using your gold bars to purchase more moves. When I fail at a level it automatically incorporated the ""watch ads"" instead of just continuing. This game is addicting, but the stupid ads take all of the fun out of it. I am uninstalling because of the ads. Which doesn't benefit the players enough to have to endure the mind numbing repetition of them. -0 rate"
"I use to play this game long time ago, when it use to be fun and when with strategy and brain you could pass levels. Now it's all about money. I do understand that you have to make some money, but ""forcing"" me to spend from level to level to level....it's so obvious and that makes it annoying and making me frustrated because you need 5 days or more to finish one level. Just an advice, people will spend more when they enjoying and loving something and not when they are annoyed and feeling used."
"Been playing this game for years and it seems it's mandatory to watch ads to finish certain levels and when there's no ads, it's like they want you to purchase boosters or else you cannot finish a level. I've been stuck on a level for a week now and it's impossible to finish because the latest update took away all the ads. Such a shame because the game is really fun but I don't pay to win."
"Need to be able to skip more. At the end of these game when they take your leftover lives and they explode to get more points, needs To be able to be skipped. It is so annoying watching it every time. I tap the screen to skip it and it just keeps playing. The other games I play like this, that final part, can be skipped and you move on to the next game. Please add that option."
Its a great game and enjoy every each level. At times too many adds. Fun and nice. The grafic design and cartoon character are nice. I love the game even at times is difficult to play. It cheers my day when stressful. It a good game for brain. Need to work out the game when the level is hard. After playing a year they have improved and different stages. Fun and has improved... love it
"Started off great but then every hard level you can never win for a few days, so either watch loads of adverts to get extra goes (which doesn't always work) or spend money like to buy goes, but after a few days the level that was impossible is suddenly possible to get past. There is no skill in this as you can't plan for what might come out next. So at the whim of if the game wants you to get past the level or not."
"Seems to require getting gold bars to finish every 3 levels or so. Often when I am on a very hard level and I cave in to buy some, it gets stuck on the payment page. When I restart they've taken my money but I gotta start the level all over again. Also noticing that when you do get one of the 15min free boosters there's suddenly 4 or 5 things that pop up to eat up that time."
"This game is a problem, I am on level 4600 already and I downloaded this to play in between classes. Its fun, but the issue is difficulty. Some levels take a week to beat and they constantly say how others spent money to beat it. It is laggy on pixel 7 pro and freezes sometimes when I am about to beat a level, meaning I end up starting over."
"Long time player of this game, i've seen a lot of updates but since the 4 last ones, the game isn't the same, wont be able to seriously advance if you don't pay or watch ads NON STOP!!!. Another issue, the game has become a lot more ""intelligent"", it knows when to give you a chance to have a few extra moves and when not to. It wants to make loose. Also the game does a lot ""self sabotage"" of our chances to win a level, it ruins our chances by strategically exploding our way out of the level. 1*"
"At this point, the game feels way too controlled and manipulated. The point of this was to be relaxing, but with 6 hard levels back-to-back, it gets more stressful and aggravating than anything. For most levels, they won't give you enough moves, matches, or boosters you need to meet a certain objective. In order to complete most levels, I need to actually spend the money I barely have to buy gold bars. Spending so much money on a game just to get by one level isn't worth it."
Downloaded the game again after a few years of not playing. Got to level 155 and down to 2 jellies. Out of moves! I have enough gold to get more moves but the little circle thingy just keeps going 'round and 'round. I have to give up and start the level over! What's going on with the Shop???
"It would seem the developers are bent on making one spend. I am no longer as thrilled by the game as I used to be. I have had experiences where there seem to be programming errors because I have several moves left, dropped all the fruits but it is still not ending the game and counting it as a loss. The hard levels are now almost impossible making the game experience so boring."
"This game is still fun overall, however, some of the levels are very hard, and in the updated version, I don't like the new sound effects because it just makes bubble sounds when making cascades, so it's hard to hear. Also, sometimes the voices for things like ""Sweet"" and ""Divine"" don't play in it just makes a ""whoosh"" sound. Also experiencing occasional crashes. Because of these reasons, I'm changing from a 5 to a 3."
"It's cool for the first six hundred or so levels, but then you start getting 5 or 6 hard levels in a row to purposely eat up boosters and get you to spend money (65 moves for $1.99? Really? 65?). I've spent the last two weeks, every night, spending ten or so lives a night trying to pass one level. This game needs an endless mode where you can just match. No stupidly unobtainable ""objectives"" and no attempts at cash grabbing. Until that happens, I'll just play bejeweled."
"Used to play this year's ago, decided to pick it back up. It used to be a casual for fun game, pay if you want to. Now you basically can't advance if you don't pay. They removed a bunch of turns on every level so it's basically impossible to win a level after maybe level 200. It's super not cool, I've been trying for weeks, and before in the time I'd advance 500 levels, I beat maybe 10, super stressful, not relaxing. I'm going to toon blast. This games ruined."
"It is a great game when the devs aren't being overly greedy. The most recent change, where the ads have been removed along with any ability to continue good streaks without spending money, has completely killed the game. I am in the 4000s for level, and it is COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE to maintain streaks or often to even advance much of the time. Some levels now take 100+ attempts to pass. I realize that there were probably a lot of complaints about the constant ads, but the ads gave bonuses."
"Really fun game, until you get to the higher levels. Like I'm on level 510 and I'm about ready to quit playing it. Because they make the levels so hard & don't give you enough moves so you're forced to keep playing the same level over & over which isn't fun, unless you want to pay 2 dollars, which is ridiculously expensive to pay 2 dollars on each level. And they purposely make the levels so hard that you can't get past them without purchasing gold bars or power ups. Not worth the trouble and $"
"It's fun and frustrating especially when you get stuck on one level for a long time. And I also have an issue where when am playing the game,then my time's up,and then I want to watch an ad to get some extra time but the moment I finish watching the ad, everything just clashes . Overall it's a nice game. I love it ,been playing for a year now"
"I've been playing candy Crush for the past few days (5 days). It's a very fun game. But, You have to pay for most of the levels in order to pass. I haven't paid for any of the levels. It's just super annoying that I spend all of my hearts and still can pass the levels. And the racing thing for the gold is annoying. Wish there was more ways to get gold. But, other than that. Pretty fun."
I like a variety of options to utilize to continue to move forward in the game and this game doesn't disappoint in that area!! I'm back a 2nd time because it's a game that is more enjoyable the further you get into the levels. It's easier to progress once you have played it before but the design is complex enough to still present a challenge and fun!!!
"Great and intuitive game. The bright colours make it much easier and nicer to look at, and it's got a nice UI. The microtransactions right in your face are annoying, but considering it's a mobile game, it's lesser compared to other games, although it does add up to all the pop ups they show with challenges."
"Love the smoothness of the game. Nice grafics and interesting events. The fishes at times leaves me frustrated when it seems that they just doesn't go where I'd hoped. And can't use candies to create fishes. The new Superstars event has made me very, very excited. Thank you for this awesome event. This a one of kind event, speaking for myself, I haven't heard or came across this kind of event in all the games I've played and I've played a lot. Superbly done👌👌👌"
"It's a beautiful game, no ads at all. But if you don't spend real money, you get stuck: no bonuses, no lives (30 Min to recharge each life!). Some games are friendly towards free players, and that's why they have chat and teams full of people. If you look for that kind of games, this is not for you. At the start it was fun, now it's stressful since you stick to a level for days and then you magically pass it, 3 very easy levels and you are stuck again. No relax, just a hint of anger 😂"
"Fun game, gets you sucked in with easy levels, lots of extras. Then, the levels get really hard, and it takes multiple lives just to beat them. And it wouldn't be a big deal, but there seems to be more hard levels than fun ones. And sometimes it takes a day or two to beat them. Not interested in that. I am uninstalling."
"This game is super addicting! I'm having a hard time putting it down! You can complete levels quickly to get large amounts of points. The game is challenging to play, but if you fail in the first round, it will let you attempt to pay, if you have enough cash, to play where you left off. Or you can retry the level by starting over. All and all this is a fun game to play!! I recommend you download it and get your candy crush on!! ❤️"
"If you are playing this game then never ever purchase anything within the game. One time you purchase then your ads are disabled forever. Ads helps in clearing the level with extra boosters at the end of the level. If there are no ads, you will have to clear the level by purchasing gold bars. Which I think is thier strategy to force the players to do purchases. I purchased a combo pack and boom, no ads for me till now and I have stopped playing it. Never do purchases within this game. Adios."
"Every day there seems to be two to five new events that aren't explained & seemingly only pop up once or twice despite claiming to be days or weeks long, which is confusing. Game play is fine when it actually works, but getting stuck on a level simply because the game won't generate the necessary matches and combos is incredibly frustrating. If I lose it should be my fault, not the game's. Suggested matches are usually worthless and distracting, and contribute to loss more than wins."
"Would give it more but ready to stop playing. Sweet Cinema is a waste of time. Watching ads and 3 out of 4 times you get an ""X"" and get nothing. The higher levels don't give you nearly enough moves; I guess the thinking is you'll purchase something. With the not telling you beforehand it's a high ""chance"" of non-reward ads and impossible levels, I can only assume my money would be wasted."
"My main beef right now is that there's a thing going on where you get a grand prize if you finish #1 three times in a row. I've done that several times and it never counts. It's super irritating. A lot of the time, you use a booster and something else comes and takes it out before you can use it. So many times, levels won't give you what you need (like a cherry for example) until you're almost out if moves. It's very frustrating."
"It's not easy but relaxing,and helps take a lot of tention off of your mind while you try to get done. The prizes and gifts along with directions are easy to understand.I like the object that it has alot more to do in the level and you can work with my family. It be a lot more fun if my phone would stop freezing up. I checked how much memeory was on my phone and it was only at 20 percent filled. I'm use to being patient with it. Since I've updated the game it's a lot easier to get though a level"
"I'm addicted. Level 400. * Was at level 400. Make sure you save your progress. I got a new phone so and I thought it was automatically being saved to my FB account IT WASN'T! I had to start over, but I'm already at level 200 so I'm 1/2 way to where I was. The levels get harder as you go higher. If you are stuck you can pay to skip a level, that's kind of cheating but 😕. Always send lives to your friends and always add more friends so they will send you lives in return for sending them some"
"I enjoy this game as a nice time waster.... But lately it's been feeling more and more like just another pay-to-win scam game. Maybe it's because of the higher level (1770 currently), but several ""nightmarishly hard"" ""hard"" and ""very hard"" levels back to back that consistently don't give you enough moves or combinations to succeed without paid boosters feels like a bit of a scam."
"I must say that this game is great for those who love to solve problems or get your mind off any stress that may be burdening you day in and day out. I don't mind a good amount of difficulty when playing a game. Yet, there's a thin line between noticeable difficulty and rigged levels. The moves or results of certain moves are very inconsistent to the play of this game. I'm assuming that this happens to help influence gamers to spend money in order to beat rounds. If so, not cool."
"They have completely changed the app and levels. At this point you cannot get anywhere without spending money. It's sad. I used to play a year or two ago and would find myself occasionally putting in a couple dollars every now and then, however that has changed. Playing now, they want money in order for me to be able to even win the so called easy levels. My guess is they are going broke so they need our money more and more!"
"Yeah... Currently at level 3783 and have noticed some of the harder levels are back to back and it's impossible to win a race; so you're forced to buy gold bars or lives. I'll say that because I love this game, I have made a purchase or two. But since I've done that, now it's like I can't get past a level quick enough to win. Might have to rethink playing this game so much."
"Hi! Candy Crush Team, Please as a request please improve some thing like hearts timer,sounds and also give some moves in hard level,this game is still fun overall, however, some of the levels are very hard, and in the updated version, I don't like the new sound effects because it just makes bubble sounds when making cascades, so it's hard to hear. Also, sometimes the voices for things like ""Sweet"" and ""Divine"" don't play in it just makes a ""whoosh"" sound. Also experiencing occasional crashes."
"Gameplay is great, but outside of that the game is filled with so much bloat that it becomes a chore to keep playing. Having to close out of 7 different 'quests' and 'special offers' that I care nothing about just to start a new level not fun. And the pig - worst part of this game hands down! I just want to match candies. Nothing more, nothing less"
"Why do iPhone users get the benefit of watching videos for lives and other items. I tried to make the game a fun, competitive activity for me and a friend but it's not enjoyable because of the unequal options. They also made a big deal about making friends. We were making many friends and in turn received hundreds of lives. Now they have a rule that you can use 20 lives from friends a day. Sometimes im on the same level for 3 weeks while my friend has moved on 20 or more levels. No longer fun.."
"Honestly the game is phenomenal I've been playing for a long time. About 5 yrs now. Granted, yeah new account because well certain issues arrived but that's alright. I love the game to the fullest extent possible. It really challenges my brain to think but also helps me calm down when I get irritated or annoyed."
"I like to play Candy Crush, but with the most recent update, I rarely get a free spin before playing a round; the Cinema sometimes shows up for a chance to win a perk, but it often disappears as soon as I open it; and I haven't seen anything akin to a vine game in several weeks.... I am playing challenging levels with two tries for perks every 24 hours, so I die a lot, and I am only allowed 20 lives/day.... I realize the goal Is to get me to spend $, but I am frustrated! :("
I was a fan of your game for a long time now. But after doing a purchase the ads for extra life and other goodies have stopped and just stuck on the same level for a almost a week now. If this is going on then I have only one option of uninstalling the game.
"This game is manipulative, and does everything in its power to get you to spend your gold (and thus spend money). The races are fake, the competitions are fake, etc. But despite all this, you can play smart. Don't spend 10 gold to continue a level. If you avoid this, you'll accumulate gold much more easily (for free). It's always better to just take the loss, then buy more lives for 12 gold."
"This was a fun game. Unfortunately, l let my granddaughter make one 99¢ purchase on our train trip several weeks ago and now I'm no longer eligible to watch ads for bonuses. Some levels are not winnable without those bonuses. I've now been stuck on the same level for 3 weeks and I quit. You'd think they'd like to have the ad revenue but apparently not."
"Once you pay some money to the game, you don't receive the program of ""view ads to earn rewards"" anymore. The levels harden and you end up paying more money. Also, this game is addictive, levels are so hard that you can play over 100 times to pass one super hard level. Some hard levels are not marked as hard, only to find yourself stuck on one level for days which they never marked as stuck, yet you find those marked as hard, very simple."
Enjoy . I like the way that they Continue to update all the Candy Crush games they have. Giving more people the opportunity to win and enjoy the game. It never gets old. Having problems with the game and it's too hard to find someone to help you I prepay by buying large packages and then can't use them and I'm losing time and money with this problem
"I reinstalled the game to see if things had improved but all I can say is all it does is try to get you to spend on boosters and lives which would be ok if the prices were reasonable but they cost almost as much as a battle pass on a console game that lasts for 3 months...these boosters or lives don't even last a day!When you reach a certain level most of them are hard levels including the ""easy"" ones and need boosters and lives to pass them. Such a shame"
"Game is ok. Seems easier than when it first came out years ago. But got so hard I just restarted it. Now I've retarded again. Today, Christmas Eve, I restarted again.. I get to level 254 and then restart. I'm not going to just play that level forever. 2/10/23. 2/18/23 restarted again. Not allowed to spend real $$. So, unless you do it is hard to progress. Reloaded again on March 1st. A game should be fun. Not pressured to spend money to progress thru the game. Doing better as of 3/27/23."
"The game starts out super fun and relaxing. It is great until you reach around level 300. At that point the game is nearly impossible unless you spend cash for gold bars. I get it you need to make money but this game has made millions already since its been out for a decade, maybe it's time to make the game fun and remain free. I would even watch some adds to earn gold bars but I will not pay for them."
"After feedback on ads, now there are none to help you 'win' a difficult round. Rounds are extremely difficult, cannot win without spending. Bought the piggy bank to see how it works and it is a one off...that should be mentioned in the sales item. Without the ads game is trying to force me to buy coins, which i refuse to. Loosing all interest in the game."
"Horrible! I was so close to level 2500 and does the app not delete my entire progress and brings me back to level 1! What's this save your progress nonsense? Why must I do that? Plus don't get me started on how you're sabotaged to lose a level, the persuasion to buy using your money to get boosters in order to win a hard level which of course you get sabotaged when close to winning it. It's not fun as how it used to be years ago. Feels like it's all about money. All my money on boosters wasted!"
Switch phones. I saved my game but when starting up the game on the new phone I had less than 5 of any boosters when over 30 of several before I switched phones. 😠 For such a huge game they've customer service is seriously lacking. Saving the game isn't intuitive or obvious.
Really sucks that once you get to level 780 you can't pass it unless you spend the money to get extra moves... Especially in a tournament. That REALLY blows. Been playing the same level for almost a week now. Not even worth having it if you have to spend money. Don't waste your time....
"This game used to be fun but developers have taken that enjoyment away now...and other folks feel the same having read some other reviews. There are now too many difficult and nightmare levels, often back to back which pretty much prevent progress without buying boosters or watching ads...which I'm now fed up of doing. So disappointed with this game."
Frustrating I was going through levels relatively OK. Got stuck on 1 so paid for gold bars. Now it seems that I can not progress through any level. It's as if it will only allow you to progress if u spend money. Don't make the same mistake I did of ever spending a penny because once you do u just become stuck on 1 for days.
Its super cool and addictive. Once I start playing it's difficult to stop. What I don't like is the fact that you make us to buy gold bars with dollars but when it's time to win you don't compensate us with dollars too. I really hope we also get compensated with real money too. Am in level 3200now
Where are the options to watch an ad to help finish a level or watch an ad for an extra daily spin. It's almost impossible to complete levels now without these options. I can't even finish the current race coz I've been on the current level for over a week!
"Bestest game ever Edit: They made it worse by adding impossible levels which can only be cleared after watching 4 ads for 1 game. So each hard level I am getting after level 1000 , i need to watch 4 ads to clear just one level that too takes 15-20 tries even after watching ads. It's written that it's for relax but it's frustrating me instead."
"This is my ultimate stress reliever especially when the pandemic started or just my go-to game to kill time. But now the game is too ""commercial"" already. There are levels which are so difficult and ridiculous that you need boosters to get them over with. I miss the times candy crush was intended for fun."
"New version of candy crush saga is so annoying and boring. Plus there is no sound of divine ,tasty , sweet etc. And also the green candy is changed to tulip like structure which looks very outdated. And please add some moves to win the game otherwise it is very impossible to win the game at 15 moves of nightmarishingly hard level . And also the color bomb automatically strikes without attraction of candies . Please kindly change to the older version like racing of the levels to get gold bars ."
Why did the booster adds go away!? made much more fun.. l even purchased a couple of things from watching adds and additional boosters. Now it's extremely frustrating to play again. Many levels impossible to pass even with buying extra lives and boosters as it's a waste of my money because I wont pass levels anyway... bring back the adds!
"I used to love this game, but not now. Because it doesn't count as a game at the moment, because it takes a ridiculous amount of time to pass a level for 500 boxes and 20 moves, you can't enjoy it at all or just pay two dollars to skip it. A level hahaha f*** candy crush group"
The game was great but now if you want to play for a while you have to pay. The max amount of lives you can get from a friend a day is 20. Also the levels past 200 are really hard for no reason. Update: multiple times now the game removed my lives. I would have 1 or 2 lives left and I claim a prize or something and go back to the map and it says I have 0 lives. What is going on?!
Completely frustrating. I used to love this game and would spend some cash to get through levels but not anymore. What happened to the occasional perk or the climbing challenge where you can win power ups? The daily treat just doesn't cut it.
"I like that the game gives you options to watch a video rather than spend money. I really Hate it when it takes that option away to make you buy gold bars. So the All-stars are just like every other game. Only played by the ones that buy there way in. To make it more competitive they should have it the other way around.. I did trade 200 play points for bars last week, not sure if they are in the mail? My points are gone but no gold bars, no game credit. DELETE."
"I will admit that this game is fun however, I have gotten to a place (level 6438) that you can not win without spending money on every level. Even the normal levels are impossible to complete. The game has become a complete money grab. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind spending a few dollars a week to play, but it has gotten ridiculous. I have been on the current level for over a week. If it continues I will be deleting again..."
"Candy Crush Saga is a most fantastic, awesome & amazing game for the players. It's an excellent, interesting & intelligent game too. Bursting the candies and going ahead by enjoying & clearing one by one level is most thrilling and very very excitement. I always enjoy the game in my leisure time and I get full of relaxation and stress free by playing this game. I LOVE TO PLAY THIS GAME FOREVER. TRULY SPEAKING, I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS CANDY CRUSH SAGA. THANKS TO THE GAME DEVELOPERS."
"You come to a certain point and it is just ""pay to play"". And someone please tell me what this moronic theory is with developers to add a bank that collects points (or gold bars in this case) that you've earned and need to move forward... But you have to buy it for $2.99."
"This game became very irritating. Levels became impossible to pass without boosters. They stopped all the ads and now require only in-game purchases. I am stuck on those extra hard levels for weeks. And no. I am not going to pay money, but I will quit the game instead. 😤"
"Fun game, but difficult to win without paid for boosters. If you enjoy it though it's worth it. I play through playwell so I am also earning point toward actual cash rewards. It's just very slow to accumulate. I play other games that are just as fun but with no points earned. It's a win win."
This game is okay. It gets annoying whenever the levels seem impossible. If they didn't feel impossible then I would have given it five stars. It keeps on eraseing my progress even whenever I log in. It's a fun game but it's not the best.
Sometimes when I need just the last ingredient you can't make it come out of the ingredient maker losing all my 20+ moves and my win streak too.. They want you to keep playing the game so they give you races and candy royales.. And you know what's fun? You can always refill your lives by changing the date but you won't get a daily reward by doing the exact same thing.. Love your tactics
"The game, as it is now, is designed to make you spend real money. If you don't, you'll get stuck on a level for a week or even more - which is annoying, not fun at all. I remember it used to be a fun game where you could win thanks to your wit and good strategy. It's no longer the case. Candy Crush Saga has turned into another money grabbing app, and I'm not willing to pay. Uninstalling it, goodbye!"
"The game started out really fun, but the higher levels get more difficult and harder to play because I refuse to buy pieces that may help. It has lost some of the fun appeal due to level difficulty and not buying any offers"
"The pop-ups are ridiculous, especially after the recent update. The piggy bank pops up every single time I go to the map, sometimes two times in a row. It's so frustrating. Please change the way pop-ups appear and how frequently."
Currently stuck on level 305. They give you 15 moves and over 200 things to beat to complete the level it just dont make sense to me. Seems like every other board I need to purchase more things in order to complete level which is trash!
I use to really like this game however lately I have been really annoyed with it. I know there are different versions of the game my boyfriend has a version you can watch short videos to get extra moves and boosters. I've been stuck on 2306 with no boosters for 7 weeks. Just crazy 🤪
"Was a good game until the constant micro transaction stuff started popping up, ""85% of players bought this boost to beat this level."" If you have to buy a boost to pass a level, it is not worth the time or money to pay. Un installed."
"I played this game when it first came out. I was so addicted to it. I had to wait for new lvls all the time. I was over 3000 lvls. I played on my iPad, and I linked the game to my Facebook. I slowly stopped playing and switched to android. I started to play again. I lost my old account. Starting over should not have been hard. But, I quickly realized this game changed. It is sad this game became greedy! I just started playing again. Spend money to pass a lvl or play 1 lvl for days."
It's a good game I just wish you can keep matching as the pieces are falling. It would make the game fast pace and still make the player be patient at the same time since there is a chance that you can still make mistakes.
"I love this game because it's so frustrating and so challenging as levels go up, but one thing interesting is that it teaches you never to give up no matter how difficult the challenge is. For you to see a better tomorrow you need to solve today's problems. I have one suggestion, make this game a Gold mine so that players can be able to sell to other players while you make more money through transaction charges. I would be so happy to have this game as a real life hustle"
"Is your thing days of frustration stuck on an unbeatable level? Maybe you're into being forced to buy additional moves in order to progress, or you like being constantly tempted to spend $2-$3 to clear level you've played 197 times. If any of these describes you this is definitely your game. If however you don't have the $$$, stress handling capabilities, or are prone to throwing your phone at your cat, dog, children, or wife out of frustration, then maybe consider something else."
"They have flashing tiles that would lead you to think that if you followed the flashing hints, you would clear the board. Not So!. Also, there are costant LOUD repitious words with almost every play. If you are alone, it's still overload. If you are around other people, it is disturbing. Best, it is a mindless & loud game. Turn off the volume & you can play the game & let your brain just numb out."
"Really very disappointed with the game, I have played so much and reached the higher level with in short span of time and have made purchases in the game and currently on level 465 where I have played atleast 30 to 40 times the same level but unable to complete it no boosters and not able to send lives and no support. I will try few more times if not will uninstall the game also to reach out to you guys is really difficult. I thought this is a very good game and players play all around the world"
"It's a very pretty and colorful game but it has too much animation. While playing, if you make 1 move the game just plays by itself not giving the chance to make other moves. And once that board is finished you have to sit and watch it finish playing itself and it takes too long. It's a game not a TV show. And nobody has that much of money to spend just to win. Officially uninstalled."
"Very fun and addicting! My only negative remark about CCS with only 200 levels of experience is in my opinion that if a player has hints toggled on, the moves that the ""hint-bot"" shows should be more accurate as a teaching tool to beat the level your on until the player is comfortable enough to toggle hints off to go at it commando. The bot is good on some levels others you will up a creek."
"This game is very fun, but addictive. And often times, very frustrating! I'm on level 6624. Some levels definitely require boosters in order to pass, but most do not! You have to strategize and plan your moves. The levels get really difficult after you get to level 3500. I usually pass most levels in 1-4 days, some require a little more time. One level took about 2 weeks. I only play after work, if I have time."
"The game is cheating. I completed the chocolate box and didn't receive any reward! Instead, the new box opened. Of course, I am stuck on the hard level, and I used to pay for extras to pass, but now I refuse. Rather uninstall the game. There are plenty of other games out there."
It's useless to keep winning the levels and collect gold bars because they can't be put to use without paying money. Each time it shows that the piggy bank is full with all 30 gold bars but one cannot access it without paying. It looks like everything is paid here. Disappointed big time!
"This game is very different now. I don't know if it's better or not. Some levels r harder than before. It seems that u don't have as many changes to gain more lives.. I guess I'll have a better idea if I am able to get passed 330 or 1100, wout first running out of every booster first???🙄😕 And why does it now pop up with the request to buy the piggy bank after every level you finish??"
"Fun till you hit the nightmare levels that require boosters to pass and in turn require money to pass. Just a POS money grab. Also, the give up button tends to not work. Oh, and if you select a power up once it'll keep using it till you deselect it and the power ups change each level so you have to check or burn power ups when you don't mean too."
The devs destroyed candy crush i use to play this game alot but now it lacks so many great features i use to complete levels to see what new area i unlocked in the map now its just the 3-4 areas repeating itself again n again it also stopped being generous with the powerups. The devs have just made the game more vibrant n colourful but removed all the beautiful features from the game which made me wanna keep playing...
It's a very entertaining game and keeps me very entertained and helps my anxiety to calm down or when I can't sleep at night im playing candy crush.. The levels r not too hard. The only thing I don't like is that u have to pay to get extra items for u to keep playing. Wish it would be free all the time. I don't have that type of money to keep wasting it on the game. Other than that it's a fun game to play with friends.
"Great Fun Addictive Game until you reach a certain level. Then you must pay to move on & pay & pay. It does throw a few workable levels here & there, BUT skill is totally removed with impossible levels with fewer moves. It gets old very fast when you reach the pay levels & see all your purchases totalled up? Paying to keep playing IS NOT SKILL? You won because you paid to & that is not a challenge or skilled based? I don't mind paying an app a bit here & there, but this is ridiculous. Sad :( Bye"
"What a ridiculous waste of time and money. I spent $5 on the ""Friday deal"" and proceeded to spend the next two hours of unlimited lives playing the same two hard levels. Just because I refused to spend more money on the darn gold bars for extra moves. This used to be a really good game back in the day. Now it's just a ridiculous way to spend money. I redownloaded this app to reminisce and enjoy myself. I will not be downloading it again."
"Everyone loves Candy Crush! Popular game that starts out easy and progresses to challenging puzzles. Friends can join, gift free lives to continue playing. Directions are easy to understand with plenty of surrounding animations to encourage you to the finish line of each level. Try it for yourself with the free awards, in app purchases are fun but addictive."
"The new map in the vertical format cut into sections with the amount of levels that are in each race. Hmmmmmm. It should be renamed Candy Race. I guess it wasn't enough that these races are not voluntary, now the whole game is centered around them. The psychology of the whole game is now centered around races. Yet the tag line is still 'Escape stress.' Takes forever to scroll to the bottom now and still don't have the skip option like Farm Heroes."
"Long time player but I think my time is done. Since the last update the game is slow, I've mysteriously lost gold bars and lives and I can't progress. Disappointing *After emailing about the issues I was told it was my problem. I'm done with this game. *"
Changing my review from a 4 to a 1! This used to be my favorite game but all of the reviews are true. Once you start getting to higher levels each puzzle is Nightmarishly Hard. I no longer recieve boosters like I did when I 1st started playing. Bravo to the company for getting you hooked with free lives & boosters in the beginning then leave you out to dry once you progress. I'm ready to uninstall this game and be a productive human being.
"2/22/23 luv the game, I'll see how it treats me. First game in a long time that doesn't keep crashing every time you open it.i need to play awhile longer before I rate with 5***** but I rate it a hard 4****because I need to play al little longer.😃😃😃 Thanx!!! My wife of is hooked now too. Well it's now 3/20/23 & I still play and enjoy myself. I'm a little confused as to the saving of the gold bars for the player who earned them, but then you SELL the bars back to the owner of the gold bars."
Candy crush used to be fun until the new upgrade...now I don't get my free boosters whenever I start a new level. And levels that are supposed to be easy are now ridiculously hard with moves that are way less. So one is forced to spend gold bars and still get no where..I'm just about to uninstall this app and do away with the stupid game.
"Exact same version as others, but mine keeps reverting to the old style. My partner gets more rewards and perks for playing like being able to watch a video to get an extra turn on a hard level i just spend days being stuck as i dont have gold bars. If i delete and re install i get the newer version until i close it and open again."
"The game is good, sometimes the setup of some of the boards is just impossible, but they do that to encourage sales. Some of the combinations are just odd, and some of the goals can also be too hard"
"The game keeps freezing, and like others have said, I'm not receiving boosters that I've ""won."" Also, I've noticed that level boosters aren't working as they should. You all need to fix this! Two years later, and the more they update this game, the more it SUCKS!! Stop freezing and stop wasting my boosters 👎🏾👎🏾 NO STARS!"
"I am extremely disappointed. I just purchased a new phone a I lost all my boosters. I googled how to get my boosters back? I've followed every possible steps with no avail my friends. This is the thing y'all, I started playing this game again after not playing for a while. I've made purchases and because of the purchases made I acquired 99+ per booster. Not because the mighty king gave me these boosters. I'm deleting it again.they call it glitch but it's another way for us to give them money."
"Edit: It's a shame that boosters aren't saved when you switch to a new device. ☹️ I had hundreds of each booster and now they're all gone. Yes, I have already read common questions under the help center. Original: Fantastic game!! So fun!!"
"Garbage pay or don't win app! Have to pay to unlock a bank or you don't actually get rewards you earn, levels designed to not let you win unless you pay for a bunch of boosters. The hints will give you suggestions that don't progress the puzzle and I have never once been given the option to watch a video ad for more turns (as others mention here) I'd gladly buy the game but I'm not into this paying to win play style. Uninstalled!"
"If I fail a level, it should be because I didn't play it right, not because the game didn't provide the proper matches or cherries, especially when it kills a win streak. Just lost level 3110 simply because the level never dropped the cherries. I had the other objective complete and all obstacles cleared with 15+ moves remaining. They're simply trying to make me spend gold bars/money and it's killing the entertainment value. Uninstalling."
"It's Totally fun and worth the time. That's why I rated 4 Stars. But it may likely drop to 3 stars for me because the ""Hard and Super Hard level"" is too much and gets you discouraged sometimes, especially when your bosters and breakers are exhausted, you just have to keep trying and failing until you exhaust the life given ;then you wait for minutes and sometimes hours it to fill up back again. All those processes can be really discouraging."
"This is an addicting game. I like it and hate it at the same time. I started playing again after deleting it a couple of years ago because I felt I was wasting hours on this game. I downloaded again during a stressful time (mistake?) They've made it much more difficult, it seems, to get through a level without buying extra boosters. Once you buy one, it's way too easy to keep buying others, and it adds up. Like any addiction, you've just gotta stop, just one more piece of candy---yeah--right.🤯"
"Candy Crush Saga is an excellent and exciting game, although the levels do get more difficult as you progress through the game, which you then need to be able to concentrate and be good at problem solving because you only have a certain amount of moves on each level, some levels even have bombs on them which also makes it harder and you only get 5 lives per game so if you've used all your lives you ether have to wait for the game to refill them or you could ask friends to send you some lives"
"I have to say, the game is guite brain challenging. But things that's odd about this game is the competition with other players, you get hooked up in one level with other for a long time and they won't move either. But once you just escape that level you will see them too at your current level too. How so? Are they bot or... Sometimes you keep swiping but it's not related to the goals of that level. They never get you closer to swiping out what's needed to be swiped out. The game is BORING"
"If there's going to be extra stuff to help in the game, like sweet cinema, let us access it at least once a day. What happened to the hot air balloons? If your going to have events where a person can be part of ""a team"" and has a chance to win gold bars once said person accomplishes what is expected give them the damn reward. I was part of ""a team"" and helped complete 80 levels or got 80 colors whatever it was and I never got my 15 gold bars."
"Gold for play. It's cool until it's not, then you'll need gold to keep your winning streak to get mega boost to start each board. There was a video you could watch for an extra boost but it's gone so win win win and if you lose...spend that gold or stay stuck Chuck!"
I play to pass time. When the game gets to the point it's calculated to be just difficult enough to make me use all of my gold bars or all of my collected powerups or start to cost money to win. I erase it and start over from the beginning clearing memories and cookie cashe saves in the app settings. Unfortunately. It's a rigged game with a complete do-over as a consolation prize.
Installed it after long time to play. But I got amazed with new update. It is so boring right now to play. All levels are super hard and they give 15 moves only to clear it. That's next to impossible. If you guys have plan to spend us money on this one then you guys are wrong about it. I want to relief my stress with this game not to lose my money on it.
"Edit: uninstalling because I cannot progress and I'm not paying for boosters A fun match three game to waste some time, but unless you start paying up for boosters it tapers off entirely before level 300, then becomes a pointless grind with hardly any progressing and more time spent watching ads for extra moves"
"I usually dont play games on my phone. I would play Solitaire, Tetris, and I remember seeing the commercial on TV and thinking it doesn't look fun. I was setting my phone up and selecting categories that I'm interested in and games was one of them. It automatically downloaded candy crush saga and I decided to give it a try. After the first round I actually enjoyed it very much! The graphics are excellent and I love the creativity of the candy. It reminds me of candy land. Download the game."
Absolutely do not spend money. Ever since I spent 99 cents it's been impossible to advance since I won't spend more. Before my purchase I was doing fine. Don't mind a challenging game but it has gotten impossible and frustrating instead of fun.
"I'm hot. Tried to play today. I was level 2400(+/-) and got sent back to level 1. There were errors on my screen. I uninstalled and reinstalled... I tried to log in with my FACEBOOK, and that was useless. Okay... I'm back at the level I should be. However, all of most of my games from my friends are gone, and my bundle..lollipops...wheels..bombs...etc. I didn't have a lot, but had some"
"This game is awesome. It's fun, relaxing,and mind challenging all in one. My kind of game. Ya just gotta try it. But be prepared to get hooked the first time you play!! I keep saying just 1 more round and before I know it an hour has passed by but it only feels like I've just begun playing. This is my go to game especially when I'm stressed. This game takes me through some of my most trying times! THANK YOU"
"Although this is a fun puzzle game, some levels are very hard which gets cleared after 1-2 weeks, i love this game but some levels are hard,and in some levels the boosters i unlocked can't be choosen which make the level harder,so please improve this otherwise this game is fun!"
Really fun game but forces you to spend money. It's fine at first but the higher you get the harder it gets to progress without boosters and gold bars so you can have made turns. It's addictive and potentially harmful. I have to delete it. I recommend the same for anyone who has addictive tendencies or impulse control struggles. Its not fun anymore.
"Loved this game, but now I can't play as it's not letting me log in with my Facebook account meaning I've lost over 1800 levels. Tried everything to make it work but still keeps saying there's an error logging in that way. I'm Not starting from level 1 again 😠"
"I can't begin how frustrated I am right now, I don't know if it's a glitch or just to make someone lose while playing. I've played candy crush for a long time now and It was going great until I reached the 1000 levels and suddenly can't seem to finish a game, used up all my Gold bars and all boosters, seems they want you to loose 😡😡 I was so mad and I had to change my 5 stars to 1 star😤"
"The algorithm makes sure you have to purchase stuff to pass a level after a certain point, no amount of skill or effort or extra perks you have work. They already have ads but the developrs have found a way to force people to pay them more than they should. Congratulations to the marketing team, great job. Uninstalling the game forever."
"I have not played this game in a long time. I really like Candy Crush, but once I get at the higher levels I will still have the same problems. Have to buy boosters to advance in the game, and watch commercials. I will stop playing again for about 1 to 2 years. Maybe I will just start from the beginning, where you have a chance to win without buying boosters, or watching ads. I give it a four star until I have to buy boosters or watch commercials."
"Impossible levels. This ""game"" is just pure frustration. Higher levels are nothing but near impossible feats without 1) having to purchase additional lives and/or 2) using one or more boosts. Free boosts are hard to come by. More often than not, I go through my 8 lives and am done in 5 minutes. Takes like 15 minutes just to get ONE life back. There's also a lot of levels where you only get like 15 or 20 moves to clear the entire board. CANDY CRUSH IS NOTHING BUT A FRUSTRATION AND CASH GRAB!!"
Loving the new update really cool. Well that was then this is now 2023 and this game is so hard to win and complete levels you have to keep playing the same game for over 60 times before it lets you play a video to replay it again and now you don't even get that option is so hard to get spins is so hard to get color bombs it's just hard to play it's not fun anymore it's super stupid I play this game to help with my anxiety but I'm going to uninstall thanks
Awfully rigged for you to spend money. It starts off giving you free options to get extra lives like watching ads but once you get into the game they no longer give that and make levels increasingly harder to the point where you need to spend gold to beat the level. Its obviously coded to do something like that. They give gold as part of the game but make it impossible to save up as they purposely rig levels to make it close to finishing but always need the extra monetary push to beat it. Awful
I've noticed that it's been more and more dificultou to finish a fase with 3 stars....than I play to analize what was happen! The fases are similar onde to another with diferent objectives BUT the limit of moves you have is less so to pass with 3stars you need to buy Gold or help....so far It was my favourite game but I don't like games that I have to buy things to pass fase!
"The most relaxing game ever. Like the free stuff and the changes from time to time Addictive. Just gets better and better as you go along. Get it!!! New boosters too, changes every week.! Can't wait for more updates and new levels!! Have a go.!! Races are fun. A great new look too.!"
"This game is so full of feces, the screen on my phone turns a shade of brown whenever I play it! I'm on a level that requires 10 fish to pass. The problem: only 8 fish come out! I guess I have to play this level until I either pay, win fish, or get extra turns somehow (it's level 5380)."
"Entertaining, variable, with no time constraints. Appreciable amount of playful sillliness. Around level 300, it gets difficult and not reasonably playable, with tens of attempts per level."
"I used to play this game daily but now I haven't played since the last update. They've changed the map and it's horrible, they've taken away races to win gold bars, there's no prize for consecutively logging in ... It's all gone. The levels have gone from being fun and challenging to impossible, which makes me believe now it's all about them making money from frustrated players buying power ups. I loved this game but I won't play it anymore."
"Used to be fun, I've been playing for a long time, but the last month or so the ai in the game is flawed. More times then not when you swipe a line to gain a exploding candy or a line candy you don't actually get rhe reward. Also the super matching candy if it falls more than two lines it explodes and you loose the ability to use them. Overall the actual game play has been terrible since December. Seems the only way to advance past the hard levels is to pay or sit on the same level for a week"
It was all good since the new update. The bonus structure is now pointless you can only spin the wheel when you have no choice to complete the level anyway. I probably delete the game if they don't fix it with the next update. Update: 2/9/2023 Still the same issues. Very disappointing!
"It's VERY annoying how desperately you want users to spend money on this. The gold bars pig, the owl, the Friday, Saturday and Sunday sales, the daily whatever, etc. We just want to play and we're bombed with ""purchase this"", ""purchase that"" things in our screen every 5 minutes. Now I remember why I stopped playing in the first place."
"Impossible to beat higher levels with the lives they give u. Being games get money for ads, it seems to me that they give u least amount of lives so that when u can't finish the levels and either watch an ad or spend money. Watching ads only give u so much to try and beat levels. Just not fun playing anymore."
"Candy Crush Saga is a highly addictive and entertaining game that keeps you hooked for hours on end. With its colorful graphics, cheerful music, and challenging levels, it's easy to see why this game has become so popular. The gameplay is simple yet challenging, and the variety of levels and obstacles keeps the game interesting and engaging. Whether you're a casual player or a hardcore gamer, Candy Crush Saga has something for everyone."
I've been playing this game for years and I love it but these days after you watch an ad for extra moves the game just closes on it's own. I've tried several times but it keeps closing. I'm thinking of deleting this game.
They rigged the game to make you watch ads so you can win... Most times when you watch the ad you actually clear the level... It's not fun if there are more than 1000 levels and I can't clear a level because I refused to watch an ad. Some might say I'm just bad at the game.... But any time I watch an ad is when I clear the level... I don't even use the extra moves... I play to relieve stress but thinking about watching an ad instantly brings more stress. No thanks. One star. Used to be good 🚮
"I love all games like this really. I started with family guy. I started with the Candy Crushes in add money with just play. Doesn't add up fast but gives me something to do. Plus I've been told by my friend I should be a gamer. Who knows. Been trying to enroll in school but some how in the last 3 years, five times .... All my stuff goes somewhere else. I can barely get into my own phone. Anyway, love having you on the ride. Stay blessed and creative"
"It used to be a fun game, but not any more. Boards now have more colours than before which makes it hard to create special candies. Boards are also crammed with blockers so no nice cascades. Typically only 20 moves despite videos showing many more moves. Boards now designed to be passable only if you spend a load of money on boosters or gold bars. I will no longer waste my time or money on this 'free' game."
If you're on a hard level don't waste your money trying to pass it won't help all it does is take your money. The new changes suck you can't get free help anymore. I'm done playing this game I've played it for 11 years and now with the changes it's no longer relaxing.
I've played for 11+ years. Level 9013 has a glitch and after spending a lot of gold bars I realized there was a problem. I contacted tech support and got a response telling me that's just the game. They didn't even look at my screen shots proving the issue. Don't waste money on this game!! Glitches will not be addressed and you'll receive an email telling you to try harder. -¿-
"Nasty nasty dull boring depressive background music ruins this game now! Been playing and enjoying this game for years, now they've suddenly decided upon themselves to change the music, no option to choose back to the original, it's now either that or turn it off. What was the thought process behind this new soundtrack, who thought it was delicious to use a soundtrack that's more suitable for a depressing war movie? Please give back the original, or at least have the options to chose both 🙏"
"Popup of app requesting to update Candy Crush app. As soon as I did I can no longer auto rotate my game. No matter what settings I try to adjust in app settings or even phone settings, it will not auto rotate the game. Pretty infuriating especially since im on level 6326 and I need the full screen horizontal when I'm playing. Hope this is just an update glitch cause this would suck if it would never auto rotate the game as I play."
Improved since I played years ago. I didn't install it came with android update. Still too many pay to win levels. Dropping 2 stars because lives that are sent keep disappearing from mailbox. Can't add if lives are full and if you check the message it just deletes the message w/ out granting the life. Don't bother trying to go beyond level 300; every few levels is an impossible pay to win one.
"The app just straight out closes and kick me out mid game and it doesn't matter if I'm on my last level to win candy royal, I lose the candy royal and I lose my streak. I just don't want the to judge that I've lost the game when IT kicks me out out of the blue mid game, the levels r stressful as it is."
"Frustrated, it can be expensive! It doesn't give enough moves and forces you to buy moves if you want to go on. They don't t need $, they making enough off the app already. Greedy! They should give us the bars we get from the Piggies to buy our moves or other boosters. What I do after about 10 tries, is delete the games and start over again..just to have free play. I'M NOT PAYING ANOTHER DIME!!!!"
"This game used to be a fun way to kill some time, however as you get to higher levels, the game is less and less fun with multiple ""super hard"" levels that just leave you stuck. Also, boosters are promised for watching advertisements, but are not given because the advertisements freeze frequently!"
I've played this game for years now but lately the games has become so frustrating because you will be stuck on the same level for weeks unless you spend real money. It takes the fun out of this game anymore. Some levels are impossible to complete without using gold bars for extra moves. Uninstalling it.
"After installing update today, can't claim anything. I.e. Booster wheel won't work, as it continously states ""contacting store"". Same goes for anything else. Also, getting rather annoyed that advancing in game play at all is only possible when paying real money to purchase items, especially with the insane amount of pop ups in between each level and after each time one plays a level."
"The gameplay is as always with Candy Crush. Unfortunately, so are the Theatrical Finishes of each level. Unable to be skipped, I've sat my phone down for 20 minutes and walked away, just to come back and the End Level ""Sugar Crush"" is still blasting away. To be able to skip that would be the only serious improvement needed in these games."
"App is fueled by excessive greed. It's designed to make you accidentally spend money by clicking through menus and hitting the wrong button. There is no confirmation, the money is just gone. Also, they will randomly drain your account of all of it's perks that cost money. When confronted, they actually said ""we don't recommend keeping these perks for long because they're not guaranteed."" I call that theft, since they are the ones who monetized it in the first place. Regulate these people."
"This game is pay to play. The levels are near impossible without boosts and it comes down to luck. Nothing is worse than having only one option to move,which doesn't help you progress,then you're forced to do another move that is useless. Way too many popups too. I don't care about your bundles so stop having them popup every two seconds"
Game has gotten so much better since they added back a lot of the free ways to get boosters! Trying to have people pay to play is a terrible idea. Love the new updates...keep the free rewards and extra fun challenges coming 😀
"I downloaded this ancient game just to leave this review. Why over a decade later are you harassing people on other games with your lame ads? If we wanted to play it, we would. Simple. & not only that, but clicking the ""x"" ONE time would be nice instead of THREE TIMES. You are a thing of the past, accept it."
"Candy Crush Saga is over 10 years old and I've happily played it a fair bit over that time. The game in its current state is the most greed-driven I've ever known it. How I know you're making it obvious is because on level 1283, the 2nd of 2 ingredients miraculously appears when the turn counter hits 1 or 0. As if by magic, you're told with no shortage of condescension you've failed the level and offered a microtransaction to help you pass. Stop rigging your game to force people to spend money."
Some of the levels are near impossible and designed to make you spend on boosters. Im stuck on a level for days and every time it fails it asks for money. At least let us watch an ad or something for some extra moves. Sadly not everyone can spend on games these days. Its just so much greed that its quite sickening.Why would you think playing the same level 70 to 80 times is fun? Just an absolute scam.
"All those impossible challenges there are not necessarily. It's supposed to be a stress-free and fun game as you claimed. Not be given us headache. It doesn't make sense at all. Difficult games with less move to solve it is wicked. Is it just to buy coins or what.? It's becoming a stress eventually. Try and work on it. In fact, I'm uninstalling this game right away. The developers are too greedy."
"This game is awesome! I just don't like how there's ads but I get you gotta make money some how. But I also don't like how you have to buy power ups/boosts for some levels and for me to get those boosts I need coins but they don't hand coins out very often so that's a little annoying. But other than that, adorable, relaxing game!"
"Played this for years. Best to over 4000 levels but too hard after that. It became unenjoyable, so started over. Other than that it is a good game and you do get rewards for watching ads."
"Something happened. I was in the levels of 10,000s and I opened the app this morning, it set me back to level one. I have even bought extras to pass those hard levels. Money wasted to be back at level one."
"Some levels are too hard compared to the moves you provide, take 255 and 260 for example. Do you think anyone can pass through that level naturally? No, it's totally impossible... I've seen many of my friends quit playing because of the same. Work on it and re-do the moves to as many as at least 25-30 moves and also increase lives to at least 10 or perhaps the more someone doesn't play, the higher the number of lives, allow the countdown to continue! Like that, one would take a day playing"
"Losing interest fast, this will soon be uninstalled which is a shame because its a great game and great to pass time however as you progress it can sometimes take days to pass just 1 level unless of course you pay for perks, lives or extra moves. I did this using some Google play rewards but refuse to put my own money into it. Why make a game near impossible to progress in this way? Stop being greedy forcing people to pay pay pay, make it a 1 time purchase instead with more chance to keep going!"
"Have been playing this game for years. Lately it's so annoying to play. It freezes at any point and also take about 10-12 minutes to play. Why is that so? Please do something about it cos it's very irritating. Also when you want to buy some moves to finish up, it just goes off. I really don't enjoy playing lately. Do something about because I have reported so many times but no changes. It's time you guys listen to players and act accordingly for us to enjoy playing."
"The game is fun to play. However, if you are at a higher level (like I'm level 5600+) and your friends are at a lower level (like 300) then you don't have the ability to give them lives unless you scroll about 200 times to where they are at to give them a life. Extremely frustrating and annoying when they can gift me life at any moment. I emailed King about it but all I received back was a generic response with a link that was useless because they aren't actually reading the email(s)."
"The puzzles are good enough to keep me playing. The ""energy"" aspect is something I detest in mobile games and trying to shove pay walls in my face every two levels is ridiculous."
I stopped getting adds to watch for extra moves at the end of rounds I can't pass. It's been over a week. I been stuck on the same level because I can't get the extra pieces unless I pay for them..
"Candy Crush isn't what it used to be. It used to be fun. Now the game just begs you for money at every turn. Seriously, your efforts don't matter. You won't win unless you pay money or painstakingly replay the same level until the system just randomly lets you win. Yes, you can get power ups for free but you need to grind extremely hard just to get ONE!! Then the game forces you to use it up in a ""nightmarishly hard level"" immediately afterwards. I don't wanna hate this game but it's hard not to"
I'm a newbie. Having fun. Learning the game. I think my rating may go up. It's been a joy thus far. Easy levels. Hard levels. A good mix for a mentally challenging game.
Every time I get a new phone I start from level 1. I find the game to be so relaxing and enjoy playing it when I'm drinking my morning coffee. I especially like the rumble option that makes the phone vibrate when combinations are made.
The initial game in the beginning is good and keeps you interested but as you progress through the levels they get more difficult and you reach a point where no boosters or gold bars are awarded at all. Difficult levels require boosters and the higher level you reach the lesser boosters you get. The game becomes frustrating to continue this way. I reached over 9500 levels and then stopped getting boosters all together. Had a terrible experience.
I've always enjoyed this game but tonight I will uninstall it. I realised as soon as I made in app purchases their options for watching ads to get more lives completely disappeared. I waited for days for that option to return. I want the option thanks! On forums they give some cock and bull story about ads are only on some accounts and not being sure when the ads would be back. Many other users have also complained that once are they made in app purchases the ads stopped. Exploitation. Bye.
it's fun sometimes it has been difficult to complete when running out of things I find it an interesting game. I don't like wasting bank money on it but I think it's a game that gives you alot of help when you use the spotted ball's that can take away alot of what you need to get rid of to complete the game to.
"Totally addictive, frustrating at times but really enjoyable. Great free in game boosters, don't despair, if you get stuck on a level you will get there in the end."
"After level 6000, my game stuck. I did't get cherries from machines. And in next level, I break all jellies, there was no more but it shows 2 left. I wait for the game to show me where it is but there was no clue even, because I break it already. but I finish it under failure. and then I play 3 level in candy royal that show me I cut 33 so far and after few hours I start playing again with 4th level of candy royal that say you cut 15. I need my refund or all that stuff back......"
"I've been playing this game on / off since years now. And while the booster issue got a bit better compared to years ago, it's still the ridiculous amount of moves you have. It's not the hard levels that frustrate me, it's the easy ones. 15 moves to clear something that needs alone 4 to 5 moves to be cleared. And the extremely annoying blinking of suggested moves is extremely distracting and not always helpful. This game is far from being relaxing."
I have finished 1st 5 times in a row and have yet to get any prizes. Also I had 45 gold bars just taken for no reason. This game sucks and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND it to anyone. I am going to uninstall the game as soon as I can.
"I used to be a fan of this game, but it's no longer fun. Beyond the 1700 level, it's become statistically impossible to pass a level using strategy alone. Just multiple pop ups and pay to play solicitations. It's all greed, greed greed...not to mention all the personal data being harvested (more greed). Don't waste your time. Uninstalling."
The game gets to a point which is ad driven. You watch an ad and you get extra life/power. However some of the ads freeze and you have to exit the game and go back into it and you lose that move or power. Very disappointing when you are working on the harder levels
"Can't pass more than one level a day. It's gotten really annoying and the opposite of fun. I'm only at level 705. Many levels are taking days to pass. Even if I use boosters and pay money to buy gold. It started really fun and I was progressing, winning levels and events. Now it just pisses me off."
I use to play this game for some years. I stopped for a while. Came back to it again. Played for couple of days and got tired of waiting of new lives. This game became definitely about spending money. Because to get to go to next level you either have to wait for ever or spend money to go through. I'm done. Don't play this game or spend money. I don't plan to spend money. BAY BAY
"Its become really repetitive and boring,very short moves given to complete incredibly hard levels,in other words they want you to buy gold,which is pretty obvious from the persistent popups shown after and before playing levels. Gone are the days when you need a lil bit of your brain thinking 5moves ahead,now its just dumb luck. Trust me i should know cos am over 5000levels..not worth relaxing with anymore so its back to chess for me.."
"I'll give the game 5 stars any day, its a great stress reliever, although there are times when I'll use days to pass 1 level but that's the whole point of any game right? Its Supposed to be challenging. Most people are here complaining about spending money to buy gold bars n all that...why? You're not forced, you could win gold bars after playing 15 levels (in the competition tho) . If the developers could make it possible for friends to share gold bars and threats, it'll be more interactive"
"I like playing this game, but there are a cpl of things I do not like about it. Seems like I, myself aint thee only one having problems with lives getting cut short or the game and also have no more moves even though there are still some moves left in a game. And I don't see why we can't just save our game as is when logging out. Whats fb got to do with this game? I mean, why do we save our game on facebook app when we could just save and log out from the game itself. Very slow updating game app"
"It really says a lot about the creaters and owners of a game when they have complete control over the game and still have to cheat in order to get people to purchase things. After a certain point in this game, they don't even hide that fact any more. Items that can help you just randomly go off before you can use them, five in a row and all you get is a bomb... I mean really, what kind of idiot can't make the levels harder? so they resort to violating the rules that they created?"
"It is become very difficult and boring game at the same time. The new updates of this came along a boring side and few moves in each level, that's make it impossible to clear all those levels and become a cause of your stress. Now I am thinking to delete this game. Zero star from my side."
"Candy crush is a great game and I love it so much, I would have given a 5 star but these days I don't understand it anymore.... It's always showing network issues even when I have enough data and it's making the game very slow and annoying 😭😭😭"
I used to enjoy this game alot but now it's getting super boring with the new updates all the level are so hard and they give brely 15 moves and no ads available for extra moves i think I'll just get over the game nd move to another to pass my time because now i get stuck on levels for days and it's super frustrating
"Update: Now, it's not crediting the lives friends send you. So when I check the box to use a life, it doesn't load the life. If you check multiple for multiple lives, it might give you 1 and the rest disappear. Uninstalling after I use my last booster. Update 2: not crediting boosters from the wheel spin."
Love playing and try to do it everyday. No matter how long I have been playing it it never gets old!. Love it! The only problem I have is not getting my rewards from chocolate box. I would appreciate if the powers that be to give me the rewards for the 2 chocolate boxes that I didn't get.it didn't take me long to catch on to the new candies the only problem I have is when I don't get the rewards I'm owed.
"Its a pretty fun game, and a timeless experience. Wait times for hearts to replenish is pretty short and youre not forced into microtransactions (aside from that piggy bank that taunts me...) You actually do get a good series of power ups and boosters, and theyre available without needing to spend real currency. Theres a lot of good mechanics and its not overwhelming!"
"Fun until you get stuck. This game is fun when you cna do the levels but some are almost impossible to do without paying for extra moves at the end with gold, I think there should be an option to watch adverts to help get boosters as I keep getting stuck on hard levels and the only way to get close to passing is to get extra moves at the end or use my current boosters."
From level 13000 onwards the game has become near to impossible. Frankly we even spend money to support the developers because it provides fun. But plain and simple lately this has turned to greed. Levels are unplayable. And considering that I am at 13000+ the comment matters. They reduced the moves to 20 on almost all levels. And the levels are near impossible. You need to use either multiple boosters or u keep collecting extra moved and need to spend gold bars to make progress. Losing fun now.
"Used to be a great, relaxing game. Hard levels were rare and gave you satisfaction when won. Now half or more of the levels are hard, and no amount of those extra events that promise boosters is going to help, because the levels are hard and need boosters to win. Trying to win levels is beginning to feel like grinding. It comes down to that this game only pretends to be free to play, because you'll only get stuck and frustrated without buying boosters. No longer relaxing. Uninstalled."
"Used to enjoy the game and I installed and played the game for many times since several years ago. Now I'm at level 330 and I believe it's getting a pay-to-win game. The moves are too low for the amount of candies which are needed to be collected. It's getting rly annoying, unlike their motto which is ""relax and play"". I'm getting more nervous than being relaxed."
"I like this game because it relaxes me. It's not fast pace, nothing jumps out at you, nothing is trying to kill you so there's no stressful shocking moments. It also has like no ads. Only time you watch ads is when you choose to. Watching ads help you complete a level and collect more boosters. I really like it."
"**DO NOT PURCHASE BOOSTER OR GOLD BUNDLES** I was stupid/bored enough to purchase my first ever booster-pack-whatever last month. The bonus lives, moves and boosters functions all immediately disappeared and harder levels became next to impossible and more frequent. L4300+ and some levels can take 200+ attempts each. Frustrating, tedious and not at all enjoyable. This is a deliberate, cynical strategy to force players into pay-to-progress. In my case, it will not be successful. Uninstalling."
"Too many invasive ads and ""click-throughs"" advertising different CC contests and such. I don't want all that extra junk, I just want to play the levels. I have to ""X"" through like 4 different ads, contest notifications just to get to the main reason I downloaded this game. So frustrating."
"Too fun! It must be illegal! LoL! It truly is super fun, and the candy looks like you could reach out & eat it! Pretty easy, difficulty increases each level but nothing too crazy yet. I've been playing 30 mins in on level 35 so far. And the BEST thing... NO ADS!! LOVE IT! I'd give it 10 out 5 stars if I could!"
"It interesting game and challenge you again yourself BUT after 600 level it become your stress not a game anymore, sometimes will take a week to finish one level some are unplayable without ads or paying. recently no ads and the levels are always looking on the way to get your money"
"Entertaining if you want to kill time but candy crush is not a game to relive stress, if anything it adds on to the stress especially when you can't pass a stage after 30-40 times trying, and also made to watch the endless advertisements for boosters or to pass easier, use candies and if you've run out, buy more candies.. Which is ridiculous! So much ads to go through and still have to pay to pass a level. I'm not going to support all those companies that has super long ads.."
Need to make it easier to win. Seems no one can win without power ups. Or have a way for players to earn power ups. Most games have ads to do this. I don't mind ads. I got stuck on a level with no power ups and reinstalled it . Im about to Uninstall it. Game is not fair to those who don't pay.
"There is a glitch and all the candies look distorted so it turns impossible to find a match, because you don't know what candy you are switching. It doesn't happen immediately, but after a few levels of playing. It is updated, I am using an s22 ultra"
"Liked the game. Played over 6100 levels, but then I changed phones and lost all of my boosters. Customer service will not help. After many attempts, unistalling all games from this develoee (King). Horrible service. All other developers helped me but them."
"The game works flawlessly, sound and graphics is are very nice, but not nice enough to pay this much! In everyone’s life there are good days, so-so days and hard days. I don’t thinking humanity would last for more than one year if everyone’s days were hard all the time. I would understand “very hard” and “nightmarishly hard” levels every 20 levels, but not when they’re every 2 or 3 levels. I’d have to probably pay $50 a week to play comfortably. Nah, thanks."
I love the game except for the fact that game turns to be very difficult and one could be stocked on the same level weeks if money isn't spent. Also there should be more chances of winning gold bars. I think if this aspect is adjusted it would be fun playing candy crush.
"This game starts of great but then you rarely get any bonuses. Today I was given two but I never actually received them. Why is this? Also,one minute I have coconut wheels etc,I don't use them but they disappear. Sort it out!!! Update... I am going to deactivate this game as you are given very few chances to move to the next level. All they want is for you to spend money."
Very boring at times. Only first week is good after that it takes so many days to clear one level by level. And it always got struck. I need to close and reopen it many times even the app and has latest version. So boring.
It's a fun game to the extent that i already been spending without realizing it just to win..i only realized my expenses when i computed it..so sad that my friend can watch ads to get rewards and i never experienced that...now I'm can't level up coz I'm avoiding to do another purchase already..spending too much on it already 😢
"Was fun, until it compels you to pay in order to win. Seemed fair for the first hundred or so, but now I'm on a level with an insane number of orders to complete, with a small area that makes setups of more than three almost impossible and with only 15 moves to do it all. And wouldn't ya know, there's an owl near the level, who says he'll help you out with some boosters, for $3.99. No thanks."
New conditions on players are very frequent. Even if you have life given by friends you can't use it. Is it some kind of joke. Are you paying any money? Why are u creating unnecessary hurdles playing this game? If you want me to delete it I will do it? Either these issues will be solved in next update or I will Uninstall it for good as it is no longer stress buster but also stress giver
"Was nice, now pretty much pay to play. Candy crush used to be great. But now I get stuck on one level for months. They want me to buy upgrades to get to the next level. Really sucks and makes the game no longer enjoyable."
"I love the music. The algorithm is sometimes annoying. Once I needed a few cherries to pass a level and I assume the algorithm was supposed to make them a rare occurrence, I was unable to pass because in all 30 of my moves I hadn't received the cherries necessary to pass and that really pissed me off. Otherwise the game is a great time waster!"
I was playing the older version up until last night and this version is better and totally different in my opinion. I got stuck on level 646 on older version for a couple of weeks and there was no way to beat that level without spending money in my opinion so I just deleted the whole app out of frustration. Hopefully this version doesn't have that or those type of situations and or pitfalls. I will see!
"Too many ridiculously hard levels. Especially frustrating when the only reason I can't win is because the game literally doesn't give me what I need (cherries for example). And lately when I finish a level, one of the mascots is on screen with the rest of it greyed out and nothing to tap to move on. Only way to get to the next level or literally any other screen is to quit the game and reopen."
"This game was always one of my favorites but I'm done now. Twice now after getting a new phone all of my progress was lost when I logged back in. Sure, I was a still on the same level I left off on. But my 500 gold bars are gone, my 1000 candy bombs, plus all my other options I can use to help with the game I had 100+ now gone, all my all my fisbies, hands and lollipops gone. All of the lives I had saved up from friends, gone. This is the second time it's happened after switching phones."
It's fun but the higher you get the more freakishly harder the levels get. I mean it's like almost every level is a hard level. It's starting to take the enjoyment out of playing it.
"I've been playing this game for around about a week , as stupid as I am I've paid about 50 dollars in this time with my credits from another game and the glitches in this game are terrible, it's like gambling syndicate, alot of the panels in the game you are ment to remove don't even turn up in some of the stages I've noticed 😕 good game though Na very bad with glitches on top of the algorithms, cheers for nothin I won't be back 👍 😕"
"I'm a 47yo man and this game has got me hooked. I avoided playing it for s VERY long time just because it looked to ""little girlish"" but then I got on it for another reason and now I can't put it down. Perfect example of not judging a book by it's cover... Still hooked and still going strong. I can't be stopped. Lol"
Used to be a great game but now every hard level is nigh on impossible unless you spend (a lot of) money. The latest update re fish (being unable to create them anymore) has made many levels completely unplayable.
So far it's great. Carries through pretty easy. I'm still in the very low levels though. We'll see how it goes. Well I'm a little farther and it gets more challenging for sure. Still a fun game to pass the time. I also like that you don't have to wait to achieve a level for days!
"I am disgusted that I have no control over my boosters activating, and then activating my other boosters too on a level. After all the ""fireworks"" were done, only 2 plays were actually accomplished😡😠 I lost that level too. If this keeps up, I WILL UNISTALL! You will not sucker me into spending money to pay game developers that are blatantly cheating me!!"
THIS GAME IS RIGGED. The first 100 levels or so are very easy. As the game goes on you slowly start to see the game cheating you out of fair playtime by destroying certain booster candies that you may have been saving to complete the level or simply never giving you the candies required to beat the level. You will find yourself stuck on levels for days attempting it over 200 times and slowly realise that King are just trying to make players who get bored make purchases to complete the level.
"I'm in the same level for 2 week but they don't give any ads to get boosters or lives. The game is going to uninstall because it doesn't decrease our stress or not entertaining. Boring day by day😑😑😑. You should take an appropriate action for us, a lot of people have this same issues."
"This game is honestly very simple. I never found this game like others today, in which it's entirely advertisements every level you complete. It's quite satisfying and cool playing this game, It's decent for casual playing. Some levels are challenges, others are easy."
It's a good game but I think some levels should be made quite easy Also the tasks in every level should be totally different.....I think you should introduce some New tasks to make it more fun.
Far too many ads and loves crashing every 2 minutes or so. Then it takes several minutes to reload. Very annoying. Plus everytime I make a purchase for more moves it asks me to make another payment. Talk about a cheap trick to make money.
"The game is entertaining except that at some point you make it difficult unnecessary. And please the ads are too long and this irritates. Most especially the Alibaba and yango ads, hmmm too annoying. Atleast if you could only allow ads with ten seconds length and thirty seconds. Kindly improve on this."
Don't know what's going on with this game. I've only got through 4 levels since Xmas!!!! It's ridiculous. Was stuck on one for 5 weeks and the one I'm on about 4 weeks. All adverts stopped so little chance of any boosters. Now finding it all very frustrating.
"Still having So much Fun!! I love how fun it is to go level after level even if I have to try a level again and again, lol. And the way it is set up, it is easy for me to take a break if I lose all my lives because I get automatic lives without having to pay. What else? I just love how colorful it is and how automated it is, making wins easier even with less skills! Thank you!!"
"I love that playing this game, its addictive. However, since my ads for extra lifes and boosters went away (I had them until I made a purchase which I thought was strange) I now get stuck on these ridiculous levels for sometimes over a day and it makes it hard to want to keep playing. That being said, still a fun game to play in my down time."
"Can we please make sure that my music doesn't stop playing when I open the app please? It's just annoying... I don't even have any game sound or music on, but every single time I'm playing my music and I open the app, it stops. Please fix this! Also, not interestes in having extra 3 moves if I add someone, put an ""x"" to close that banner, it's just annoying..."
Gotta pay to enjoy your play! I thoroughly enjoy this game but it would be much better if your skill got you boosts and the levels had more reasonable move amounts. It gets frustrating to use the bars then magically pass the level a move or 2 later. I am going to have to stop playing so much because REAL MONEY is used to make the game enjoyable most of the time! To have the bars put into the piggy bank then have to pay to get them out is frustrating too! I understand profit but chaching!!
"This game is good....but can I have ads to boost the hard levels. It really so unfair to not give ads freely when needed. I like playing this game so much but it's becoming boring now. I can't try one level for more than a day, and I end up still trying for a week. Please check out on that@candycrushmananger"
"DONT SPEND MONEY the game decides if you win or lose on a percentage at the beginning of the game. You can ofcourse change it by spending more dough. Otherwise, this is one hella dope free game. I havent spent a dime and even with the low percentage of winning. It's still enjoyable. Also, running out of lives is a good way to tell me to go out and touch grass."
Level 146 almost made me quit the game. I was stuck on it for days and finally had enough and used half my powerups to clear the level. Some levels are painfully easy to being so hard you literally waste a week trying to beat it. Not to mention they shove microtransactions and ads at every turn. Very greedy tactics from such a big game. It's unfortunate they make levels so hard they basically force you to spend money by buying powerups/extra moves.
"Gotten worse. Not only should this be fun and relaxing and it has become stressful with near impossible levels back to back, but ALSO the Daily Treat Machine suddenly disappeared for days. I assumed they removed it from the game, but it wasn't appearing this morning, then suddenly it appeared again and I lost all of my progress due to no fault of my own."
"It has gotten so annoying right when your leveling up it starts to cut off and doesn't let you continue with the moveing of some candy .it stops you from playing !n it won't move where you want it to move , but the game it self freezes once your beating it .it takes the fun out of it .it only lets you win if they doing the moving !! I'm deleting this app .😔😏"
"This is always been a great game, but recently I find that the ads are getting longer and more repetitive. And often when I click on the ad link to get extra moves at the end of the game, sometimes I get the extra moves, and sometimes the app just hangs up."
"Rigged game, tricks you into spending money. You can only get so far before they start manipulating you. You'll get SO close to finishing a difficult board, then when you need 1 green candy to win, the game will only give you orange and blue. It happens again and again. Once, I made a single 99 cent purchase, then suddenly for 10 minutes I got every candy I needed, exactly on time. If you don't pay to win, the game will purposely get you just ONE MOVE away from clearing a board, then SCREW YOU."
"This game is still fun when it's fair. It just isn't fair. You'd have to be blind to not notice how manipulated it is. Basically, if you want to have truly random distribution of candies and obstacles, you'd better keep burning those boosters and gold bars and show some willingness to cough up money for more. The new version has tons of hard levels that won't allow you to come close until you spend. A level may give you 20 moves, but if you spend some gold bars they'll give you 40 extra lol"
I recently lost progress and gold bars. I could not get progress back. I was on level 1728. Started from level one last night was awarded 50 gold bars but they were taken away. I sent emails in last night and this morning. Still have not received missing gold bars or a response. This is the only thing that makes the game terrible. I still feel the exact same way . I was unable to obtain my progress and when I did have to start all the way back over. I won 50 gold bars and then they were taken.
Updating my review. It is pay to play. Made it to level 300 and you cannot win this level without some of the extra stuff they sell. (I have literally been stuck on this level and tried to beat it over a month now )It's a game and there is no way I will pay $10 for enough bonus pieces to win one level. It is ridiculous and this is what is wrong with America
"This game is ridiculous. Idk why I've kept it all these years. I've been stuck on this one level for over two weeks because I refuse to buy gold to get more moves. But it's almost impossible to clear with so little moves. Especially when the fish you use hit any random candy, and not something that will actually help by being gone."
"all the levels are now money making. candy crush is no longer the same. i have had enough of those levels. i would recommend the game in 2020, but not anymore. their stupid redesigns removed the ""fun"" feature of the game their absurd level buffs made the game no longer enjoyable. In the past, the first 1000 levels are easy and fun to play. now they are full of nearly impossible levels that are basically impossible unless you make purchases. King, good job ruining the game"
"I like this game but there are too many hard levels that take ages to finally crack mixed in with levels that I have no idea what I did but I blitzed it first go. I am not prepared to keep buying the ""easy out"" options so it a slow process to progress! I really like the game but it is not user friendly for those that don't want to keep buying sweets to be able to keep playing."
Level 147 needs to be fixed because if you break all the chocolate at once you can't possibly get the required 10 and win. I got two disco balls and combined them and broke all the chocolates but there are only 9 at the bottom and you need 10 to win but once you destroy all the chocolate no more comes back so you guys have a serious logic error!!!!!!!!!!!! You owe me gold bars
"Fun game I've been playing it for years. However I have been experiencing a glitch for awhile, whenever I open the app my music stops playing and I keep having to go back and forth turning it on the back to the game it's very annoying. Contacted tech support and got no response."
"I'm totally disappointed and frustrated with this app. When I play this game and don't complete the level it doesn't give me the option to use my coins or receive boosters. The circle just goes around and around, buffing. Every time I play this game it repeatedly does the same thing, over and over again. Don't want to uninstall the app but I'm so discussed with this app."
It shouldn't be impossible to pass a level without buying something. I've played the same level at least 20 times. Ridiculous! I'm not gonna pay every single time I get a hard level. My son's major video games don't cost that much. Wow! Upon reading more reviews I feel so stupid. I'm on level 245 and I can't beat it. Played like 20 times and that's too much for me.
"2023: reinstalled 2 years later ..stuck at same level (1095) for 3 days...unistalled AGAIN. (2021) Almost a year later I return to the game and it's still an Ad fest and money grab. Takes too long for lives to replenish. Too many annoyances with this game. After a few days, I'm deleting again. I prefer to watch paint dry."
"The game is ok. It was fun for a couple of days but you quickly get to levels that aren't really feasible with the number of moves allowed so you need special pieces and unless you want to spend money you run out fairly quickly. Typically I play games for months, this one lost me after one week."
Being stuck in the higher levels for days with no chance passing without gold bars doesn't make this a casual game anymore. And not being able to earn free gold bars through events for...... you guessed it. Being stuck on a level for days. Feels like I'm being forced to purchase just to pass this level. This game was fun till this problem.
"This game is definitely addicting, but it's so rigged it's not even funny. I've spent so much money trying to beat levels(which is exactly what they want you to do) that I'm upset at myself at this point. Because something always happens to where even MORE money is required to continue along. Unless you feel like waiting days or more for your lives to refill in order to pass certain levels. I think I'm done with this game. It's not even enjoyable any more. It's just frustrating."
"Ad not available... It's getting old watching a 30 second video and then at the end it tells you ""Ad not available"" and no reward. I've been on the same level for awhile, I'll probably just uninstall and move on. Ok, this game is great, they do help you pass levels without paying. Problem now is, I've been playing a hard level and it took a while to pass. I finally passed, won the level. Now I'm stuck playing the level again. I don't want to deal with it again."
"I absolutely love this game but have mixed feelings about the recent addition of optional ads in exchange for extra moves or other bonuses. It's nice to have the 2nd chance to complete a level, but the extra time expended can be problematic for those who of us who don't have good self-control about when to stop playing!"
"This game is getting too annoying. When there are hard levels, super hard levels, night Marshingly hard level why the moves are so less, where it is known that you cannot complete such levels with less number of moves. We have to purchase moves then the game gets completed in hardly next 5-10 moves then why they are already not provided. After purchase of moves all the other moves are wasted. It takes more than a week to complete a level. Please do something to improve."
"Gave it a second chance. I enjoy the game. My previous issue seem to have been fixed. Now the only issue i have is with ads freezing, preventing me from getting the reward. Need to hard shut down the app and restart."
The game keeps freezing up at the end. I get a spinning wheel and indicates it is connecting to Play Store. But it never connects. This prevents me from getting the option to continue playing either by using gold bars or watching a few ads. My only option is to close the game.
My experience with this app has been very highly recommendable. But I started losing trust with you after I made an order purchase which was never delivered and no refund was made. I have done several emails without any response to a point whereby I feel the best option is now to delete the app and and just engage in other games.
Bad experience with the irritating and repetitive ad of Instagram which is the only ad I have been watching numerous times daily despite the fact that I have already installed the app long ago. Is this the only ad that candy crush has. Very rarely other ads are shown. Else your game is very good and I have crossed 4000 +levels already. Thank you
"Great game!! but SO MANY EVENTS. It's too much to click thru/out of after each level, would love an option to pay a one time $3-$5 for the game and be able to turn off all online access/events/messaging/friend requests etc..."
"Very fun, indeed THE BEST match three out there, would highly recommend, only thing is is that you might find it annoying to run out of 'lives' if you were unable to complete a level. However this can easily be resolved by adding friends and asking for lives."
"Very satisfying to play, but can't progress past level 27 for some reason? Also the game penalises you for not having Farcebook because if you run out of lives you're basically locked out of the game until they ""recharge"" which makes no sense to me. Just let us keep trying until we pass the level! Don't recommend this game to play while a passenger because of this reason."
"😢 when you earn the scrolls, it used to be $1.99 for the reward, now it's $7.99. that's crazy!! Yes, you get a little more but not $6 worth more. I know you need to make your money but that's taking advantage. And the piggy bank used to hold 60 gold bars, now it's 30 to cash out at the same price. Makes me not even want to participate in the spending money parts of the game. Eventually, I'll uninstall and not play because the higher levels are impossible to beat without boosters"
I lost my ability to earn boosters and extra moves by watching ads. This happened after I purchased gold bars with cash. Now it won't let me win a level without basically purchasing more gold bars. Cannot afford to do this all the time. I have been playing for years.
"I've played this game for a few years. Lately, I've been playing it everyday just for stress relief. The last twenty four hours definitely have not been stress free because I have not been credited for any of the 6 Booster Wheel or Daily Treat Machine Machine prizes that I've won. I am never going to pay to play this game because it takes the fun out of it to just buy things that will help you get through the levels instead of using your brain. When we earn something, give it to us."
"PAY WALL Really enjoyed playing game until i tried to save my progress by logging into Facebook and so i could send and receive gifts. I lost all my gold in the process. Tried to get help and was basically told i should not have saved my gold and got no help. Thanks allot for nothing. A added plus, I now get multiple attempts to sell me gold every screen change. Since i can't spend i can't play."
The game is very good overall but recently I've noticed some glitches and the levels have gotten almost impossible. You have to pay or get lucky to win. I still like the game but until there are some changes I wouldn't suggest getting it unless your willing to pay some money
"Initially it was very gud but after reaching higher levels every steps seems more difficult and reduce interest to continue further, we feel like some level must be played forever to complete and this is disappointing. If the levels can be cleared within 3-4 lives then it would encourage players to continue further orelse seems boring. I have stopped for many months playing this game due to this reason. Make levels more interesting and bit easier to retain the intrest of the players."
"Redesign for cash grab. Played to lvl 2000 on old phone and started again on new phone. The redesigned levels are all the same. Not enough moves and a bunch of jelly and multi hit blocks EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. Need to get super lucky and designed to fleece money as those blocks and jellies lend themselves to booster usage. The ""difficult"" levels have small workable areas at first, forcing you to match 3s and burn through 50 percent of your moves before tackling anything. Ad nauseum bs."
"Been playing one level for a day straight, with all the boosts and everything and can't pass. Ridiculous. 'Swipe the stress away.' Yeah right. You get life or boosters for 30 minutes, but it lasts shorter. Some boosters don't do a thing, just explode. Don't recommend."
"Tediously impossible after a while. Essentially at that point, it's trying to scam you into spending on boosters by constant fails or the temptation provoked by constantly losing the booster streak. Also, it should 100000000% be illegal for striped fish to swim into non-candies. Waste of a power up since it's NOT A CANDY THAT CAN BE CHANGED. (Also the game suggests moves at an excessive rate. Can't look over the ""floor plan"" of the level for a second w/o it trying to rush you with a suggestion.)"
"Fun game, cute storylines, lots of options to watch a video to earn boosters. But for several months now there have been blank ads that don't play a video so you lose the opportunity to get the booster which often results in losing the game, which is not fun at all."
Ever since I updated the app I can't see ads for lives and extra moves. I am stuck on one level for the past five days. This is getting very difficult to pass one level without the help of extra moves. It's kinda boring now.
"Used gold for extra moves twice in a row and the last ingredient never dropped. Had to be a glitch, really ruins the game when things like that happen. Also had the last combos not complete... Like there will be 3 of the same in a row that never crushed on the last move... This happened a few times now."
"This game used to be fun to play, but since I have been in the higher levels, I often run out of levels. I have to wait for the developers to create more. When they do, they only offer a few moves and are very difficult to pass. Also, now the game is trying to FORCE me to play with a ""crew."" I hate that! I literally can not go further until I choose my crew! I like to play the game on my own. I don't want to be forced into teams or competitions! I refuse to play unless they make some changes"
Pretty decently fun game to play. My only complaint is constantly going into races with other people. I wish it was more optional because even if you don't purposely participate it gets annoying when the leader board automatically pops up after a each level.
Day by day King games have become more greedy. I can see the reduced number of moves in levels where previously there were at least few more moves (between 5-10 moves reduced) were available in same level. Only purpose of King is watch more ads and/or buy more moves than ever before. Shouldn't there be at least 30 moves minimum criteria for levels. I'm around 4900 level and the target to clear 90 tiles which are double locked in 15 moves is deathly impossible.
"Have been playing for years and still not bored. Always new challenges, just wish there were some new combos to make. Also, reward boosters should not be combinations you can make yourself on a level. Overall though, really do enjoy this game."
Once you hit level 500 you have to spend money to get to the next level. I am on level 850 it is impossible to move forward without money. You only have 1 opportunity to achieve gold bars and it to is slum pickens and if you get bars it is only 1. Not worth playing at high levels.
I'm on level 9840. I have beat it 4 times and it gets a glitch in it and will not stop busting candy so I hit the skip part and then it just freezes! How can I advance if it will not let me. I have been playing this game for 10 years. Help!!!!!! Please
"Supeer mind blowing puzzle game. I like it. The matrix of the game needs review and rationalised, some times a nightmerishly hard level is cleared in first attempt without any booster and the other time a simple level needs a lot of work to do.۔۔۔.. However it is still a great fun."
Not played the game for years so decied to start again from scratch mostly enjoyable but now it's got ridiculously stupid to play with 8 hard/difficult leveles in a row currently on level 269. Definitely feel likes it's been set up so you have to pay to clear levels... starting to think I may uninstall it as not worth playing
"Decided to download and play again after a year and it's still the same b.s. Stuck on a level that I can't pass, even with boosters, can't pass it! I also saw advertisements for this game, stating, this is a fun and relaxing game! Can someone say false advertisement! Ain't relaxing at all! In fact all it does is stress you out! Someone should sue! If I could rate this zero stars I would! Don't waste your time downloading! It's a pay to win game!"
I love it because it is super challenging once you get up in the levels. What sucks is only having 5 lives is not enough to get through super hard levels. I feel it's almost impossible to beat some levels without any extra powers and lives.
I love the game just that some levels are extremely challenging. Especially level 785. That level is bugged. I have being playing it for d past two months and am still stuck in d level. I don't know but please try n do something cause i might be forced to uninstall d game. But because of how i love it i didn't 🥰. Please fix level 785🥺
"Enjoyable, but deeply skewed to create a need to pay to play. You can feel the game's gears moving to make it more difficult to play without paying. Their finger is clearly on the scales. To be expected, but you are generally used to games being less obvious. Play for 2-3 days, then give up forever."
"While I really enjoy the game, however purchasing from it is extremely problematic. Been good while since making in app purchase and unfortunately things have not improved. Money taken off card, yet the game crashed and I've not got what I paid for. Can't get through to support, as Kings website doesn't open that page. Giving up. The amount was not large, just won't do that again. Think before you buy anything here."
I like the different levels of challenges. Could use more opportunities to win gold bars. I agree of what I wrote above and add on that occasionally the regular levels are harder than hard levels. Nonetheless it's a lot of fun. Thank you
"I like the game, but when I can't get a level our, it gets annoying and then I delete the game. Level 445 are just that. You don't earn enough gols bars to clear more moves and I am stuck. Doing this a few times more then bye-bye game. It must be fun, not annoying"
"Horrible customer service. Downloaded game to gain free things for Golf Clash with TapJoy Thought I achieved levels to be rewarded but wasn't rewarded the promised gems. Followed the process, but got an email back that was quite insulting saying it was impossible for me to reach the level. I researched it myself and realized I confused a map level vs an overall level. That person responded could have seen my mistake but chose to imply I was cheating."
"I have been Crushing Candy since a long time.. aside from occasional update glitches they usually get handled promptly. My main concerns occured after id puchased a ,""hard level booster pack"" 1.99+tax. Im not sure if thats what got me through that lvl or not..my point is..up to that point i had ALWAYS had the option of spinnig for extra turns ,buying extra turns or quitting. Its the same with Soda Crush. I am about to. It seems like total strangers took over and are trying to eliminate CRUSH"
"There is clearly flaws to the game, colour bombs exploding for no reason when they drop and not fall in any colour combo, also the exploding candy bomb doesn't fire much out or scattered enough and the fact that you can have loads of candy wheels yet can only use on selective levels is wrong they should be available on every level like other stuff is. Only gave it a 1 as not able to go lower"
"Some levels are more stressful than others. If you've been ulon a level more than 9 times, the algorithm should have built in intuitive intelligence to allow you to advance to the next level. #IsItJustMe"
"Very disappointed, my spouse & I both downloaded the game & started playing, both of us on the same day, on the same model phone, except his has races built-in, which gives him the ability to earn gold bars, mine on the other hand does not. I've check for updates. I emailed King describing this issue & they emailed back saying ""they only come around every so often"", well he has a race available every day, earning bars & I have yet to get one, no consistency in player experience, please fix now!!"
"User friendly. I went through about 3 rounds. It looks like it might be addictive if one statrts concentrating too much on it. But it's good for small kids to keep them away from drugs. I wouldn't mind recommending it to friends, family, and colleagues. I am not sure if we have a similar sort of games that Will suite aged people like me. I would love to get recommendations for additional games of the same nature. I would like to congradulate the developers for smooth performance of their system."
"Best game ever but why are there so many hard levels per episode? With each new updates the hard levels in each episode go higher. It can be really frustrating after playing an hard level, you'll play super hard level, nightmarishly hard level, crazily hard level and they can all be 8/7 in each episodes. Please find solutions."
"Blatant game manipulation to make you lose and spend money. There was a level where it was so obvious, the mechanics is that you have to wait for a cherry to spawn and make it drop to the bottom of the screen. I've done with all the cherries except one which never showed up even after spending 400 Gold 500+ extra moves. This is when it hit me that this game is not a puzzle game, it's a farming game and you are the gold."
"I LOVE playing CC but have recently noticed when I purchase coins, and then use them, it's been taking more than what's required. To continue playing, it's 10 coins. When I'm finished the level, I noticed that it's taking more than 10, sometimes as much as 20. No one to contact to get refunds. Shame shame CC!"
"I used to play kind of easily, without using too much boost. I started playing again yesterday and I'm always out of moves... I don't know what happened... I need to use all my boost and gold bar to not even pass a level... It's just a pay to win now... It's sad because the game was really fun, but unplayable without great luck or great back account..."
"Pretty fun but way too easy to get stuck on a level. Always comes down to luck. Spent 3 days stuck on a level. Was considering spending money until I won with 0 moves left. Gives you powerups daily and in game currency can be won by winning races, but again, designed to make you spend money."
"There's numerous times when watching ads that one freezes so I have to close the game and miss out on beating a level. Also the amount of notifications between levels is annoying. Overall just an average, ok game."
"Very addictive game. Just wish that every time you finish a level and still have moves left, instead of using them as boosters at end of the level, they should be saved for the next one."
"A lot of the levels you make so hard you have no choice but to spend gold to continue, and in turn if you don't have it you must buy it. Making Candy Crush a pay to play game. I have one gold piece left and when that is gone I'll be done playing this and move on to the next game."
"I have been playing this game for almost 10 years and within the last couple weeks, I've noticed that it doesn't finish the moves in the game and just ends the round. I have lost multiple levels and add-ons because of this, which it's just wasting money, It's frustrating."
"The ads are beyond ridiculous. You shouldn't have to exit out of 72 pop-ups everytime you're on the map. My games are closing out mid game and if I'm listening to music while playing, it kicks me out of my level and reboots. I've also had ads play and nothing happens... Screen goes black or says no rewards"
This game was fun. But sometimes it's boring especially for the hard level and plus...the bonus is quite small. The theme of the game is relax and calm...at the moment the game turns into stress and evokes emotions. This does not match the theme of the game.
"This is the worst game i ever played, am at 678 th level where i was in the race i had to complete this level to get the rewards of the race so I used almost 100 gold bars to get extra moves because I wasn't getting that berries 🍒 only one berry had to fall but I was very disappointed i lost all my gold bars also rewards and i don't even get to see ads"
"I'd love this game from the day it was established, but recently it became boring to play. The maps graphics is enticing and the levels are fun of super extreme hard. Please do some you lose your customers."
"I'm going to uninstall this game soon. When the ads are coming, there were chances to go to next level. But I'm stuck at a level from past 15 days and also it's losing my interest in this game. I don't know why they've removed the ads but I don't like this update. Also I won't suggest this game to anyone anymore because it's losing my interest so I'm going to uninstall it."
"I love this game, am on level 4800something., what i hate is the intense difficult, you pretend to take a way stress from us but you literally add us stress, me failing a level almost 100times messes with my mental health, make things a little more realistic atleast a person can fail to complete a level with just the lack on one 2 or 4 moves, but 15moves yest the game requires 25 is just not right, fix you're selves king otherwise you'll be left to play your hard game"
"Decent game, the problem is the same with many games. Ruined by greed. They overload you with ads, or like candy crush they design the game around forcing you to buy over and over. It cost money to create and run games, they deserve to profit but then greed takes over and they push things until the games feel much less enjoyable. Most games aren't designed to be good anymore, they are designed to draw you in and milk you for every dollar they can. I'm over it. UNINSTALLED"
"Fun to pass the time, BUT I opened the app to continue my progress and clicked to do the update when it popped up. Went back in after the update was complete to continue on level 2681, but when I open that level it gives me level 20.....what's up with that?? How do I fix it?"
When a game cannot be won without purchasing boosters you frustrate gamers. Playing the same level dozens of time eliminates all enjoyment. I've now given up on Candy Crush Saga as the only way to advance is to buy boosters. I got drawn into it and spent far more than the game is worth. No more! I'll try my luck but will never pay again.
"I started this game over recently after playing it years ago. The game is fun and addicting until right about level 250. At that point, it's impossible to clear a level without using an entire day's worth of lives, spending actual money, or being forced to watch 10 million ads. They don't even try to hide their implicit design tactics and it's not cute. Maybe try something more ethical??"
"The latest version is screwed up. I can't even play online as I used to, wish I never updated it. Imagine being in the middle of playing a nightmarishly hard level and the the the game just exits and mind you I've used the boosters that I'm not gonna get back. So frustrating 😤"
"While it's fun to watch things get blown up when I start a good cascade, this game doesn't explain how things work. For example, how is chocolate made? It's designed to make you spend money, and that's annoying. But still, lots of things blow up, which is very satisfying"
i love playing.. I have had a lot of issues with my different accounts merging.. I've had to cut my losses and make a whole new one and they have been very helpful by giving me some boosters and putting me back on the level.. i will no longer have more than one game on each device
"I dont normally write reviews. However, there are too many hard levels now, and being stuck on one level for days on end, is just not enjoyable anymore. I'm quitting the game and uninstalling it! Used to be such a good game to kill a bit of time. It's totally ruined now."
"It's a good game. I made my account and I collected more than 1000 gold bars and many more boosters. But when I switched my phone, when I log in same account on another mobile, my all good bars and boosters were gone. This is really very annoying and hurting because all the gold bars need more than 6 months to be collected So please check that. Now I am adding that its very much lacking and too annoying also.Whenever I used to collect gifts and boost wheel it is lacking.Now it's being very bad."
Objective ....... clear 1000 striped candy with 1 move.......didn't complete this easy level? we will give you an extra move for 10 gold bars which will cost you £2. Still didn't complete it? We'll give you another move and 1 striped candy for 16 gold for £4. You can see where I'm going with this........ God this game used to be fun. Now it's just a cash grab and if you are doing well with levels it will whack 3 hard/extremely hard levels to slow your progress. Was a 5* game but is now a 1* game
"Why Ad is not showing during games, it becomes difficult to pass a level and takes month for single tough level, now a days not enjoying the game it gets irritating and boring. The feature is like they are not giving the option to win, if you don't want that player not pass the level then why you have created such a game. Everything has stopping point."
Sometimes i just get stuck on a level for weeks and which force me to buy stuff which are way expensive. And once you make the purchase you won't get goodies via free ads. You won't see the option of ads for goodies. Very bad marketing. Ain't gonn pay anything. Will simply uninstall the game. Thank you king for such game
"I have been playing this game for years and am on level 5018 and have never paid for anything. Boosters are awarded for loyalty and winning the most levels in a week. Candy Royale allows you to win gold bars and my current balance is at 1103 , I have been over 1500. Obviously the game is a business but one can play for free and get some where."
"Amazing game so far, the only game I spent hours to play everyday without getting bored. The only question I have is how to know if I'm being part of the tournament? I keep seeing prompt notification to participate in the All star tournament and once I click on play, it only direct me to the main game page and not the tournament page. What am I doing wrong to join the tournament proper?"
"Good game, I would have game 5 stars but it's hard to get gold, adds to get boosters, and you have to pay for most of the stuff. I think you shouldn't have to pay real money to get gold or boosters. Not have to pay 5 dollars for boosters on the nightmare/really hard levels. That's all I have to say, please do something about this! 🤧"
"No longer fun. Playing against bots. Levels too hard to pass without boosters. Boosters harder to obtain. Too many glitches with app. Used to be a fun game. Not anymore...plus too many disgusting, inappropriate or political ads. What a turn off!"
"I have been playing this game for almost a decade. And I am finally giving it up. You CANNOT simply play the game anymore. You have to X out of so much fluff. The developers are hellbent on making you become ""friends"" with strangers, you have to wait till the screen clears lest you end up having stupid, incessant ""challenges"" from the one ""friend"" you got tricked into accepting. After EVERY life. ""Discovered"" Royal Match, and it's SO much more fun! Over Candy Crush forever."
I love this game. Been playing for years! Still playing for 7 yrs. Love the races! I don't even know how long l have been playing this game. Lot's of new ways to win gold and prizes. Still playing year after year Love the new levels. Wonderful game. Glad to get that gold for races. I have been playing for yrs now. K love tame can't wait to get home and play
"First it says ""swipe your stress"" and when the level fails it uses phrases like ""you failed"" ""you didn't reach the goal"" and ""give up"" . It may trigger someone's trauma or someone who is actually trying to destress themselves by playing your game. I feel like this must be rephrased. Thank you"
"I love this game so much,it is fantastic... But the problems am facing in hard level is wat I can't explain🥺before there's always a supporting tips that will help u win faster but now can't even see any of them anymore...no more free bubble blast left alone the rainbow color blast,pls u guys should do something about it before it becomes more boring to us."
"I think they hate their users based on the way the game will cheat you. If you get an award, don't think that you can end the app instead of hitting the claim button. When you do that, the reward is gone. Striped candy doesn't form predictably. Candy doesn't bounce predictably. Chutes labeled for one type of candy will almost never drop that if you need it. The daily bonus I was on 30 days and it went away. Then it came back and I was at square one. Save your money."
Candycrush is a messed up game. I had 15 extra lives and it only gave me 6 of them. Where the rest of them went I have no clue but this isn' t the first time its happened. It happens everytime I need to use my extra lives given by friends. I have spent all the money I'm gonna spend on candycrush and I aint spending anymore. But if I had it I would. No doubt.😊
"The gold bars that are collected cannot be used to buy boosters even with 30 gold bars in the piggy bank. It always takes you to the store to spend money instead, feels like a rip off. Otherwise, the game is okay to play."
"They released a QA version to the store. It wiped out everyone's lives and despite them saying it's fixed, it isn't. All power-ups are gone. Back to zero. Don't trust King. And certainly don't do in-app purchases - they may well screw-up and you'll lose them all."
It is very satisfying watching all of those sweets explode. Some levels are impossible. Spending is inevitable. The levels should be made easier so we can freeplay.
"They just want your money! Even if you pay to have hame enhancements itsno guarantee that you will progress, and I am just wasting money on nothing. It's a shame that the game is so hard and seems rigged, so you don't win without paying. But now, even if you do pay, the levels are so hard you don't get anywhere."
"Interesting game. As you advance in level, the ploy is to ensure you pend to win difficult levels. If you don't spend it can take multiple tries to win."
"1. We should be able to use our gold bars to purchase booster ect. It make 0 since 2 have 2 use cash on something we earned. 2. The boosters should be given more often if 4 no other reasons but extend the life of the game & be able 2 save them 4 later levels. It takes 2long 2 get your lives back. 3. Maybe make a way 2 boost past levels w certain boosts. Make away 2 play w your friends N certain tournaments. 3. Create a way to edit your PROFILE, picture, name ect.. or make a easier way. Thx."
"Since updating it yesterday, the app keeps freezing, I'm on level 6323 which is a 'super hard level'. Imagine, I've been stuck on it for a few days, finally completed it, only for the app to freeze as the starts pop up, meaning... I have to do it again!"
Decided to start playing again after years. I was enjoying it until not once but twice I lost progress. Both times I was 100% logged in with FB (and double checked) but both last night and this evening I lost at least 10 levels of progress. Which is aggravating because I used powerups and items and did not get those back. I also bought items to aid in beating those levels that has now gone to complete waste. So angry I could break my phone. Most likely going to uninstall again.
"Addictive at first but play-ability quickly decreases. For example, currently stuck on level 3496 with over 100 attempts. This isnt the first level like this either. It quite often seems luck is a big factor in whether a level can be beaten or not. I understand the game needs to make money by getting people to purchase help, and ive done that from time to time, but refuse to when a level is just done right nasty. Kills the fun. These levels used to be easier and have since been made alot harder."
"I am on level 12883 now but I think I have had enough. I got to this level without spending any money and without watching any adverts I could not tell you what they are, but I am absolutely fed up with these long adverts (20/30 Seconds) . No longer an enjoyable game. A 5 second advert is sufficient if people are interested they will open the ad."
"Soooooo addicting! Great stress relief.....fast forward to 2023, not so fun anymore as I've reached the higher levels I find them impossible to pass w/o buying a few extra moves here and there but it adds up! After reading other's comments I'm glad I'm not the only one that feels that this game is no longer enjoyable and is definitely a cash grab!"
Great time killer I have literally been sitting here for the past few hours playing and it's been a blast definitely recommended the only thing I would change is I wish the ads for rewards were a little shorter sometimes the 30 second ads are closer to a minute in length which is fine but some people don't wanna have to watch that long of a ad please make the ads like 15 seconds at most this way the game can still have ads and they won't be super long
"I hate this game i am constantly getting harassed to play this game and it sucks and everytime i try to do something this game starts playing in the background even after i undownloaded it, it still playing the background music i hope they get rid of all Candy Crush games because it is for old people and we want new games that are more fun not some dumb old person game."
Playing games is for fun. But this game when it reaches level 1500 and above makes it stressful. Opportunity to walk a few steps with many tasks that are impossible to complete which ultimately requires players to buy. Delete this game !
"Game is fun and all but I don't appreciate you drawing people in so hardly to buy things. Then when they do, they don't receive what they bought. I purchased a pack for an hour of unlimited hearts and I didn't get a single second. Disgraceful, I don't have money to just throw around, I have only a few dollars I can spend each month to spoil myself. :("
"Started playing again...and am hooked of course. As annoying as the ads are....it was nice to have the option to watch ads to get more lives, turns, boosters, etc. Now, of a sudden, that option is gone, the only option to continue is to buy.....no thanks. There shouldn't be limited tries on the ""nightmarishly hard"" levels......let us have unlimited tries once in awhile. Some levels take days to complete.....having to wait for lives...very frustrating."
"Game is good. Is what it is. Candy crush. Solid platform and game itself. But I play it on Android, my wife plays on IPhone. She can watch videos to get help, not me though. Idk. Random disappointment rant after being stuck on a level for days now and look over and she's just watching videos and getting boosters left an right. O well."
This game is pretty cool I love that sexy voice just like the other one it gets smaller and smaller those pieces on each level good job on the some of the rewards I don't get them when you tell me rate this game just like the other ones did not get rewards
Fun game but requires too much money to play and progress. It's no longer fun from that point. You earn gold from playing but have to buy that gold before you can use for any purchases. Even accepting free lives from friends is restricted to a certain number. So annoying. I had to uninstall!! PLEASE MAKE COCONUT WHEELS WON PLAYERS USABLE ON ALL LEVELS...🤷🏿‍♂️
"Candy crush is fun! Since you can play offline, it makes this an app that you can play whenever. Although it may get boring at times, it will make it fun again with fun competitions against friends and many more!"
"I have reached level 3880 of this mostly enjoyable game. For the last week however, it has become extremely frustrating. On the Candy Royale challenge where you have to win 7 levels in a row at the first attempt, and if you do you share a whole load of gold bars, after each level when you tap to continue, the screen freezes for ages. I have to switch off for about half an hour then go back. This keeps happening on every single level. Please try to get this fixed."
"Ad not available... It's getting old watching a 30 second video and then at the end it tells you ""Ad not available "" and no reward. I've been on the same level for awhile, I'll probably just uninstall and move on. Ok, this game is great, they do help you pass levels without paying. Problem now is, I've been playing a hard level and it took a while to pass. I finally passed, won the level. Now I'm stuck playing the level again. I don't want to deal with it again."
"This game is very addictive! I've been playing it 4 long time! But the game will decide for you when you can win, and it pushes you to buy gold for extra moves and makes it extra more harder when using booster candys, I'm tired of this s***t, not going to pay a dime, and not going to play!"
"Overall a fun game. But once you get into more of the ""nightmarishly hard levels,"" they become almost impossible to beat. You have limited moves and need extra boosters to win, and even then that's not a sure win. After EVERY level, an ad comes up to get more boosters, but for real money. You have to refresh the app to bypass the ad. Essentially you have to buy your way into winning the harder levels, which defeats the point of a free game."
"Just okay...This game can be fun at times, but sometimes levels are quite challenging and difficult to pass, without boosters. However, the most recent annoyance is the weird vibration 📳 during game play. Hopefully you'll add a feature to disable it, because I find it more distracting than anything and takes away the focus that's often needed to master a level."
"I originally started playing Candy Crush Saga in 2012. It was fun and engaging. I played it off and on for several yrs then lost interest. I decided to download it again about a month ago. It's just not the same. You use to be able to beat levels with strategy, now it's all about the money. It's boring and uninteresting when you have to make purchases to beat certain levels. Also, have had several issues with moves being taken away when when using boosters. Not near as fun anymore. Disappointed"
"Like a slot machine you can't leave. Good for a while, then becomes a pay to win, or watch adds to win. To begin, it is fun as you improve. Then it gets worse and worse, as you have to watch adds and / or pay in order to have enough turn to win a level. It becomes luck and pay, not skill beyond a certain level. I like this game, so if they change it to have enough turns to win a level, i will watch adds between levels."
"This game just isn't good. The biggest issue is how often you're given an offer to purchase something. Every time you finish a level or navigate through any part of the game, you get a pop up. There is a ""race"" system where you play against other people to finish 10 levels the fastest. The only problem is you always get stuck on the hardest (10th level). If anything this game is good for passing time considering you'll be stuck on a level for a week. The lives system sucks too, let me play."
"One of your recent ads continually glitches the game. It goes straight to a black screen and nothing happens. The only way to get the game to work is to completely shut it down and restart, therefore losing your progress on that level, or if the ad comes on prior to starting a level it causes the waste of a life without the ability to play the level."
"The game used to be fun. But man, the amount of pop-ups between levels is insane. I've been stuck on a level and have had no ads to help out with any of it for the past two days. Kind of getting annoying being stuck on the same level for over a week and even with buying bundles, still can't beat it! I've wasted entire hour long perks trying to beat the same level and can't. Even the ""normal"" levels are almost impossible to beat. I'm done spending money on this game."
"I used to love this game, but like so many are saying, it's changed for the worse. The levels are almost impossible to beat at times (even with boosters). And it never used to have so many hard levels in a row. I just had three super hard levels following a nightmarishly hard level. What gives? Please change it back to when it was challenging, but not impossible."
Gets ridiculously difficult and hard to progress. It's great until towards around level 100 when it seems like nearly every level for a good 80 levels is difficult. There needs to be a good balance of levels but there isn't. Being stuck on a level for 2 weeks and then each level there after taking days isn't fun. Also it constantly tries to get you to spend money on it.
"Totally love Candy Crush!, could literally play it all day... I get lost in the game! EDIT: I gave this game a 5 star back in 2020 but after the recent update I don't think it deserves that. The game currently lags and the screen freezes after each level. You lose time on extra boosters and the fun fades away. I thought the point of an “upgrade” is to debug and enhance the game. Please King, deal with the lagging issue and the game freeze issue too. Thanks."
"I reinstalled this for the nostalgia, but it's too hard to be any fun anymore. Every fifth level, if not less, is ""nightmarishly hard"" and 100% designed to make you pay to win. You don't get lucky, three of your moves are locked behind advertisements, and even the win streak bonus isn't enough for a win. I had to look one level up online just to see if it was possible, and you'd never believe it. The browser version of candy crush gets more moves per level. Uninstalled after a week."
"It can be fun. However, it stops working after every game now, forcing me to close & reopen, which is really frustrating. It's like it can't handle all the pop-ups. There are so many, like 8 pop-ups between each game (challenges, gold scrolls, stars, etc., etc.). Half the time it doesn't save my progress either."
"Mostly enjoyable, just a bit annoying when you are at the precipice of winning a level and suddenly the things disappear or change so you can't finish and have to watch an ad (or three) in order to win. When that happens more than not, then I get frustrated and just quit...if that's the game goal then congrats to the programmers. More success = more players."
"This is the best game u can play before the sleeping because it gives you 3 minutes of playing! Too many hard levels and your 5 lifes will run out quickly and you will have to buy gold otherwise you must play the level 100 time to pass it, the game become toxic and cashcow and I deleted the game after 8 years, the developers become more greedy and do everything to force you to spend money."
"Fun game but does anyone have an issue where you can't exit out of the screen that wants you to pay $2.99 for an upgrade? I've literally had to quit the game 7-8 times because I couldn't get out of that screen. The funny thing is.... despite not being able to hit the x on the top right, best believe it will allow you to hit the $2.99 button and charge you. It's a little messed up actually. Please fix this bug..."
"A materialistic firm and a game. If it is normal for a player to play one level 174 times and have no theoretical chance to pass, then I was wrong! This is how I claim that they set up the game so that the players buy help and get a pass. You will not get a single cent from me just because I would rather win in poker than in your game which is rigged for the player to lose. Goodbye"
Way too hard than it ought to be. Even levels that are meant to be easy are still so difficult and when they realise you need afew moves to finish the level which you can get by watching ads they make sure no ads appear. Considering just leaving the game
"Frustrated with how expensive gold bars are 20 for $2.99 sometimes they might go on sale 20 bars for $1.99 ; funny how the boosters cost 19 gold bars for 3 just 3 boosters, and if you want 10 lollipop boosters are 59 gold bars so that's $9.00 for lollipops that will be used in approx 10 minutes. The spaceship is a waste when you use one and they throw wrapped candies when you don't need them. You can purchase 1 of those for $3.00. Weekly race went from 55 to 45 gold bars you could win. Greedy!"
"I loved this game so much. Not anymore. Some of the levels have 14 moves and you have to get rid of 65+ blocks and fruits. LITERALLY Impossible without rewards and prizes. I guess it's to force us to use real $$, which I hate doing but have had to do multiple times after playing a level 35+ times. It's not fun anymore 😩 just a pathetic way to make us pay to play."
"I will no longer watch your commercials until you stop allowing them to collect data on me. We both will lose out until you inform me that you no longer allow commercials to collect personal data. Forcing me to opt out via a complicated process is unconscionable, and unacceptable. I give you a ZERO rating, but had to give you a 1 in order to comment here."
"I love the encouragement in the game and I just love it overall it is a great puzzle game and it takes time to solve, sometimes and it's really fun. My only complaint is I get kicked out sometimes and it really fusturates me but over the time I have had this game it's is really fun I always recommend this game to my friends and co workers so they can experience it too."
"The level of this game has become very difficult compared to before. It takes a few days to pass a level, moreover it is almost impossible without boosters. And my profile rank is not showing, even after many updates it is not showing.👎👎"
Since last update whenever playon option is pressed the who screen turns black. very disgusting and boring as one has to start all over again after closing all the pages.
"What happened to the ads to get free moves and boosters? It used to be a fun game because you could actually advance without having to pay for everything..Made it almost to level 5000, and now I'm thinking about uninstalling it.."
Used to be fun. This app has become a pure ad machine. The levels are clearly fixed to ensure this. Don't believe me? Try playing after turning all your connections off and it's a totally different experience.
When I got my new phone I don't know if I uploaded candy crush or it was already on it. But there were two. Thinking it was just two of the same I played on the one as I always did. One day I picked the other one and must have got an advance version. It did not play the same and I need to know far into the game was I. I tried to play the game a few times but couldn't figure it out. Sence then it has disappeared and I didn't get the level.
This game used to be fun. Level 9800 Now it takes days sometimes a week to win 1 game. They want you to spend money. Not all versions have an option to watch ads. That needs to be available to everyone
"I love candy crush and have been playing it for years,but it's getting annoying, am stock in a hard level for weeks,I have exhausted all my boosters, and cannot get ads to help me finish up the hard levels,at first I thought it was my wifi or phone but I get same complaints from my friends too, am tired. Candy crush bring back ads please the hard levels are too much."
Nice game but the ads you show are quite long and also kindly try to reduce the amount of time for the state of survival game on your app. It is getting quite irritating.
"Fun until you get to levels you can't pass unless you 'buy' extras. This is why I stopped playing awhile ago. Tried getting through the same level about 50 times now... no longer fun & I'm not paying for extras in order to just pass a level, empty a piggy bank, etc. Many other free, stress reliving games out there. Revised: can watch video ads to help you get additional moves. Revised again- isn't relaxing when you can't get through a level for days. Sick & tired of the candy bombs."
"Every time I purchase gold bars after running out of moves, I get booted off the game having to start over. I've been cheated out of so much money. Now after purchasing a bundle pack, I didn't receive it. DO NOT INSTALL! Scam!"
The candy crush app does not show up on my screen with the other apps. I have to go into settings each time I want to play it which is ridiculous. It also doesn't update on my ipad.
"Fun game, but after I got a couple hundred levels in there started to be a ""prepare yourself"" pop-up after failed levels that offers a few boosts for $2.99. the problem is, the ""x"" to close this pop-up doesn't work, and the game has to be fully closed an relaunched to continue to play. A lot of the later levels take many tries so this is a very tedious process and makes the game not worth it."
"There are people who are getting in game ads to get additional lives and turns after a game is lost. This helps them to finish that one hard level. Others do not have this feature and it's completely random, you can't enable it. It creates a disadvantage from one player to another and for me it ruined the challenge experience. On the king forums, they completely ignore the complaints about this. That alone deserves this bad rating, deleted the game and I will never play again."
"Loving the game, but what happened to the option to watch advertisements for extra moves feature? That worked very well for difficult levels."
most of the levels are to hard & frustrating to complete even with powerups . & the limited amount of lives to finish the hard/very hard levels is ridiculous and not worth it . very unsatisfied. this game is impossible and I am going to undownload it if it continues on like this
"I requested a refund for a few packages that I paid for and never received the game never honored that. They actually blamed it on the Google play store so I contacted them and just to be told that the play store isn't who I contact it's the game candy crush saga. Nobody's gotten back to me and I lost $20 due to this after spending at least $60 on the game within a 2 month period. And I have purchased boosters and NEVER received them, the free ones you get daily I never received too."
Prizes aren't always delivered when earned. Game play can be very difficult. I'm losing interest quickly. A few easy boards then you give us a pile of hard ones. Boring. Same old same old.
This game sucks. Earlier it was fun playing candy crush. But now after the takeover the developer sucks. People get stuck at every level for weeks together as they have reduced moves at some levels where there is zero chances of clearing that level. People get irritated to the level to uninstall this game forever and look for better gaming options available in the store. Thanks for the people or the ones who destroyed the happiness by taking over ownership of this app.
Awesome I truly enjoy this game fun relaxing good it's still awesome game some areas are very challenging. I really enjoy playing it Thank you.I just find this game challenging. It's not as easy as it looks that makes it goog interesting.
This game is exceptional. I strongly recommend this game to anyone and everyone who is looking to by time or staying cool and collective. I anjoy playing this game when I'm home from work mostly on a the weekend. You can add your friends to join the game which makes it more fun and interesting. The higher you climb the harder it gets. If you like a challenge then this is definitely the game for you. Once you have your friends added you can request lives to continue on with your challenge. Luv it
The app is totally different from other than the one apps which gives the advertisement of another thing candy crush saga is the game of breaking dome color full jellies which is interesting for anyone to and the features the promos which are used to crush the crush the candies is the way to achieve the next level of fun but how so ever this game is bot much fantastic the feature are not opened with the good time that should be opened earlier and should be used I. Good manner many The common fr
"It's a really good game. It's satisfying, entertaining, a stress reliever, and a really good time killer. Except some of the levels either doesn't give you enough moves or has a glitch."
Very good game b...u...t... for example no 151 of the game I've been returning replaying it and always getting 1 star only although i've been successful many times i like to get 3 stars if not 2 and the moving score to the stars are sometimes very fast others too turtle slow.
"Places deceptive ads in other apps. Uninstalled. Trash company. Ads that jump into screen where normal options are. Makes you ""accidently"" try to make a purchase. Button placement is designed to encourage this."
"This app is absolutely amazing and addictive. However, I suggest the founder should consider converting the points earned or levels crossed into web 3.0 digital coins, for the benefit of users and the app ecosystem in general."
"Good fun but not great, the game is designed for micro transactions, there are popups all the time and later on its near impossible to pass levels without booster help, difficult to play for free, it gets frustrating when you reach a block, which is why i stopped playing for years, only to come back because I was a bit bored to be reminded that yes the game is fun and there are many unique levels but ultimately you gonna hit a paywall. Do what you will with this info."
"This game is getting more annoying. Had to freeze it for almost two months with playing. First, hard levels are more than the normal levels( hard, super hard and nightmarishly) what's all these?😫 secondly, some hard levels aren't actually hard compared to normal levels. Then numbers of moves for the hard levels are too poor and one easily fails. Also, instead of bringing ads, you won't see them thereby losing all your streaks. DO SOMETHING!"
Tired of spending so much money and then when you have to get so many cherries only a couple come out and then you lose everything thing. Very disappointed. You take our money and then screw us with not putting out the items you've supposed to get. I've spent a lot of money on this and I'm done.
"This is totally fun! Challenging levels, keeps your mind sharp if you plan your moves. Nice graphics, easy on the eyes.😊"
"I started the game over and there's a new thing, 50 free gold bars!!! Yay! Prior review: Not enough opportunities to win gold bars. We should be allowed to keep the extra tries we don't use after buying them with gold bars."
"Nice play,very captivating. For countries that do not deal or transact in dollars we get a raw deal. We cannot buy lives ti continue playing and that makes the game annoying. Ther are times when i have suspended playing for weeks just because i was frastrated. I wish the developer could find other ways of purchasing."
I'm in level 12733. Levels r too hard to clear nowadays. Also no hammer or free switch boosters. Always get colour bomb or jelly fish. No proper gold bars added when we clear the episodes. Also we don't want 15 or 20 or 25minutes free boosters. Instead give us boosters. Irritating to the core.
The game is great been playing games for years always has the same problems not receiving the rewards and having problems when I purchased and it doesn't show up or the rewards for the purchase and no solution when I attempted to find out why
"Cheat u to click on ads for more steps to complete level. Eg. Needed to clear the springs to clear the level. But it does not provide enough springs for you to clear until you left last step, then the springs appear. How bad the designer. Cheater."
"It's a very good game, it's really interesting.... Since 3months I m a member of this game and i m standing in the level 240 at present... But this 240 level is too hard level I ever experienced in this 3 months since from last 2week I m trying to complete it but I m not succeed.... But overall it's an amazing game go for it👍🏻"
"Addictive and beautiful.. i love the game should have give 5 stars but i just don't understand why the developers kept removing things from the game that will benefit the players like the ability to watch ads to earn boasters or the ""fast five team up"".. i hated the game after both features where removed.. the game just became boring and unplayable. Please put them back, i beg you in the name of God"
"Sucks, used to be fun. Now they want money. You will be stuck on a level for weeks. Give new challenges with few moves. No options for free moves or boosters. Sad they don't show any love to folks playing for years."
I used to enjoy this game it was a good way to relax at the end of the day. It is now just annoying you dont get enough moves to even get half way thru levels and it takes a week to get thru 1 if your lucky I am at 13067.Time to move on.
"We all know how addicting the game is, so my review is for the developers. I contact them about an issue with the store not connecting, and me losing everything I had, and they responded with a form letter on how else I might contact them. I follow their instructions on their alternative contact and received another form letter. I still can't access the store."
Good game for offline&online both way. I am collecting some rewards by playing online. currently I want to give 3 stars because this apps has created only sell system.game is enjoyable but some hard .after incomplete level and end of live it make absolutely force to buy the lives by money.payment system is credit or debit card only not a comfortable for all. (from 🇳🇵)
Literally makes you buy things because level is unpassable without more moves. Then when you use coins to keep trying a level it gives you 5 moves to make you pay a higher rate to play. Ridiculous. Think I'll be uninstalling this.
"What's happened? After I updated the app, all the winning beads are gone from the events section! I have been first on the list and now the whole competition is gone!! Btw, i hate the new map. Pls bring the old one back. The new one is so annoying!"
Ok. So DO NOT spend mo ey and don't expect your winnings to always come through. I spent money on this game anD never got my gold bars. 2 times. Then I won a race and because I didn't screen shot it I wasn't given my gold bars. They have to many pop up things to either buy or race so you have click to clear it and you end up clearing more out. Then u expected. Yeah it passes the time. But this game is suppose to be for kids and they screw over adults. Shame on us and shame on them
"Hard levels are now much more than normal levels (hard, super hard, nightmarishly hard levels to break) and it's getting so annoying. Also, please bring back the original sound, this new sound is wack."
"always a fun way to pass the time by, sometimes really easy, sometimes difficult. Furthermore it's all for good, you get to exercise you're brain"
"Had to download the new upgrade to continue playing and now the app constantly stops working and exits out in the middle of game play. So disappointing, probably going to uninstall soon if it keeps up."
I have already completed 13540 levels. No doubt I'm one of The best players of The world. But it’s a matter of regret that I didn’t get any unlimited free booster for the last three months. In this stage the levels are very hard. New levels hardly completed in first effort. So I have decided not to play if I don’t get extra opportunity.
I played this game years ago when at first came out and took it off my phone I don't know when I upgraded and all my friends are playing it again so I decided to start over I must admit it's a lot more fun than I remember and it's a relaxing game however the prices have gone up but With patients you can make it without half into purchase anything the only thing I would save in purchases may be the piggy bank because if not it gets annoying and bugs you tell you pay for it.
It's fun. Pretty easy and pretty much was #1. Now at level 138 a day in a half or so. I don't purchase on games that don't provide real money. This one you will need to purchase to complete. I'll play it the rest of the day just to see than delete.
Yet again what is point????? I spend 39 gold bars and then fail so lost. I then spend last 10 gold bars on 45 extra moves and still no good.... now have 3 bars and extra 45 points for 10 bars. Seriously I am uninstalling now. Why why why. No doubt you are paid loads but seriously... not fun not relaxing. Can't believe you can do this to loyal players....
"Everyone is saying the exact same thing about this game, it was fun and relaxing, now it is frustrating and is clearly about paying for extras, it's clear the creators are aware of this and they haven't bothered to acknowledge a single complaint!!! When money is involved obviously to them customer service goes out the window. Pathetic!!!! Just going to delete it!!!"
"HELP !! I'm stuck on level 502. I have to collect jelly, no problem, I have to collect one frog , how ? I don't know what to do, and does it have to be the same color as the one that shows the goals for that level ? Can someone please help ? I can't email king unless I install an app for Calendar ? After reading the other reviews, I agree, am uninstalling"
I just lost all my progrees and my 1st place in the qualifiers all my purchases have gone boosters etc and I am back at lvl 1. It asked me to link my Facebook so as to not loose my progress. This is not good and I am really disappointed in such a well establushed game customer service is no help. Be warned dont link any accounts or you will lose everything :(.
"Candy crush is entertaining and obsessive sometimes ,some instructions are complicated to understand. And apart from asking players to buy why not try having them win money instead. I understand that one of the goal is profit making but also try to give incentive this will not only boost the number of players but also make the players motivated"
"Great game! No ads! The 22ish minutes between new lives really slows things down, but it's a fair waiting period for a free game. Not so long it's unplayable, and tempting to buy lives when you're on a roll."
It's definitely a fun game however when my old phones battery stopped charging I was on level 658 and I've been unable to transfer it all to my new phone! The game cheats BIG TIME ! Like not giving you earned rewards and constantly detonating every explosive candies right as you line them up to clear the board I'm getting soo angry at how bad it is I'm having thoughts of discontinuing to play Candy Crush King I'm feeling that giving it two stars is me being over generous ! Contact me for help
"The game is interesting, but on some devices the game crashes on certain levels making the experience unpleasant. It gets worse when you to higher levels."
You unreasonably made some stages hard. It makes the game looks frustrating and annoying. Game is supposed to be fun and not annoying...we play games to ease stress and free our anxiety. But some of the level in this game are unreasonably set up.
"Its fun when you are a beginner or mid level player. Its ridiculous after level 12900. Its impossible. There are nothing but extremely difficult levels, even the levels not marked difficult are terrible to get through. Every opportunity to compete for boosters like the ""lets start a streak"" fail because you cant get a streak going when it takes so many tries to pass one level. So much for relaxing and unwinding."
In love with the game but honestly why do you give boosters yet choose for me which level needs which booster. Its so frustrating especially when you are stuck on a level for days and you know you have boosters you can't use. Please allow us to use all our boosters when we want and on whatever level we want.
I've watched ads to continue the game the 3 to get the extra moves and the blasting thing and it kicks me back to the phone screen and loses my progress I'm done with this game I guess I'll Play something else that won't keep losing my win streak it's sad because I love this game unfortunately I'm not going to keep losing everything after watching 3 ads not worth the download or even playing
"If I had known I wouldn't have updated this game, it now a trash most level are now extremely hard, to pass each level you have to buy powerups or watch various ads to get powerups... It's now a game designed to extort money from the players."
I am playing this about 5 to 6 years. It is very mind relaxing game and fun also. Some levels are very hard which didn't complete without using boosters. I played this game when I stuck something and trying to get it off. That's why I really like this game.
"This is a fun game, but, I've been stuck on level 137 like forever. I don't like to use my credit or debit cards to buy coins or extra moves. I'm a very private person & I don't like to share my information. Also, the game freeze up. Please resolve this issue asap. I'd appreciate it. Thank you for your help."
Bored! You're either clicking through a million pop ups trying to get to play the game. Once on the game I feel like I'm just sat watching the game play itself. I don't like the way it flashes telling you which ones to move straight away. Doesn't give you chance to just play the game yourself. Bored of it.
"Fun game and you don't have to spend a bunch of money to play and win. The instructions leave much to be desired. I'm on level 200 now and I still don't understand some of what is happening. And the help menu isn't much help. Still, though, pretty fun time waster."
"Having the same issue mentioned by drpepper. I play one round and when I don't pass the level, I get a pop up that can't be cleared away unless I completely close the app and start again. I tried reinstalling (and lost my gifted lives and power ups). It worked better for a few hours but now is doing the same thing as before. I've been playing for years, but am currently really frustrated that I can only play one round at a time. Please help!"
Love the game except it literally crashes and lags terrible anymore. Makes me want to delete the whole app. I've played for like an hour this morning and it's crashed 6 times!!! Y'all need to fix this!
I made a huge mistake and purchased some gold bars to move past a level. Now I'm stuck at another and I can't get watch ads to earn boosters. I refuse to purchase anymore anything on this app.
"I play every single day. Sometimes twice a day. For it to say you ""lost upgrades"" when you spin the wheel is asinine! Are you supposed to log in every hour?! This definitely needs to be fixed!"
I'm on level 4694 just did the latest update and the little cartoon booster machine that looks like trumpets has disappeared along with the chocolate box just as I was about to do the 4th task and claim 10 gold bars along with an hour of lives. Bloody annoying and often feel like uninstalling.
"Good game, fun to play. However, android users are disadvantaged compared to iOS. My partner place this on their iPhone and whenever she loses she has the option to watch ads to get more moves but we are unable to do so on android. We were having a competition on who could keep the higher level, but she has a greater advantage over me being allowed to have extra moves when I do no. Rated 2 stars."
Only thing have to say is your ads on other games suck. Why do I have to click the x 4 separate times just so you can get me to download this very below average game. It can't possibly get more people to download it ffs.
This game is so satisfying when you manage to finish the hard level without using any powerup. Deduct 1 star because sometimes i feels like the developer purposely make the level hard to make player bought the microtransaction for the powerup.
"Like this but it's hard in place ad u just cannot do it, unless u buy to get u through it. I think they should give u more help with things ,in the game the very hard ones u stay on that for ages. Unless u pay them money to beable to do it."
"A-holes use sound and got me in trouble! I have silent in the game settings for a reason! Then this stupid ad starts blaring! And it wasn't one of the normal ads, it was a built in one to play some mini game of theirs."
Played this on and off since 2013 currently on level 3559! Very rarely play it these days as the levels are so difficult to pass...Obviously done to try and make the player pay for boosters to pass the levels. The levels aint even enjoyable to play anymore!
I saved my progress and then deleted the app for a little bit. I tried to re-download and continue playing but instead of continuing where I left off (in the 400s) it's making me start all over at level 1.
"I downloaded the app again and I have been trying to retrieve my progress that I linked with my Facebook account but it's not working. I enter my email address and password and it simply loads, refreshes and shows the same page requesting for my email address and password again. I hope nothing is wrong, I have played a lot of levels already and I don't want to lose it all! Please help me resolve this as soon as possible!"
"Very Interactive and good game. Match 3 for little take away of the board, match different candy's 4 for lined candys that blow up in a line, 5 for wrapped bomb candys that then turn into a bomb to be matched yet again with any number of them to then blow the area up, to gain in the game. Or 6 or more matched candys for the freckles to come up choosing one candy next to it to explode all of those typed of candy's."
This is a awsome game but having much load in mine phone if company can help to less in load then its v nice to me. Otherwise its a very nice nd time spending game i love to play it. Its stressless for anybody . Its such a beaitiful game gives rewards too achieve more levels n gold bars too. Rewards can help nd ofcource friends also give lifelines to achieve more levels nd rewards. Overall its very precious for me . My family always saying me to come out from its having much load on urs phone.
Hi i purchase the season pass why I did not receive the free life 1 hours and free rewards for 15 minutes? This was the second time purchase that i did not receive it. And I thought when purchase it i can claim without complete a level.Feel like being cheated!! can't claim the reward for X9!!
Sometimes it’s very rubbish game because in every hard or super hard lavel there are no alternative option on the last moment & only needed one move or one task remaining but there are no ads or other option to pass any difficult levels... So that i recognise this game sometimes it’s very 3rd class game than others... 😡😡👎👎👎
"This is always been my all-time favorite game. But I have a complaint. When I log onto my second device. It doesn't give me the same rewards or options to use. I thought it was going to be the same. No matter which device you tend to use. No extras, like I have on my original device. So I'm forced to use my original device to get the same effects And rewards. That's crummy."
"ETA Suddenly no gold during one race streak?? Rigged/ sabotages moves. ChocBox rewards changed. Ugly graphics. Crashes during play, fewer cinema rewards, boosters & extra moves (+UFOs) now. Freezes at time to collect a reward. Bomb does not get all the candy colours it is supposed to. Fish are different now, peck at useless or already cleared candies. UFOs now, too. Fantastic 5 removed for Weekly Contest that can't be opted out of to avoid the pop-ups. ""Level Objective"" pop-up freezes at times."
For some reason now that it's changed it won't fit the screen of my tablet. So I guess you don't want me playing your game anymore. Because it's so narrow it doesn't even fill out my little tablet screen too small it sucks now . You know it's really sucks that it's so small on my tablet now realize that some people need a bigger screen I don't care if it curves around my screen I'm going to have to find a game where it'll fit my tablet.
I have been playing this game for over 10 years and I have loved it but now I am looking for a different game to play because this one has gotten ridiculous I watch all the ads and that doesn't bother me but I will not pay to play I made it to 13120 but I think I am done I am very sad What happened to all the gold bars!!!!!!!once again on a level that you can't pass only playing to get prizes found another game to play that atleast lets me play that is fun THIS GAME HAS TURNED INTO A BIG JOKE!!
I've just passed 4000 and I find that the levels are far more harder than before. I have to pay to play to pass every single level by purchasing gold or boosters. This is just not on. Will not be spending any more money. Thank you very much.
"If I could somehow give this game 0 stars I would, it's very obvious that it's pay to win, any boss level is impossible, unless you literally by gold to for extra turn because that purposely don't give you enough move, but when you fail they offer just enough to beat the level."
"It's unfair when you're a good player,you get much less rewards/ boosters,coins,etc.a terrible and detrimental experience in my own personal opinion.initially I spent a lot of money to experience playing this game,but have come to the conclusion that your way under rewarded as you gain experience and forced to pay more money to advance pass stages that a impossible to pass with basic tools,boosters etc, initially I rated it 5 stars,now it's been reduced to a one star,this is my opinion"
"The game is in consistent regarding how /when candy bombs explode. In other words the game cheats. In addition, unused lives for each level pass should accumulate rather than starting each level with only 5 lives."
Its amazing and good!! The graphics is tho so yes this is a very good game and it needs to improve it a little bit not sure about the lags and things happening but i will give this a 5 star if they fix it cuz everytime i opened it it somehow lags so please fix it but it is a very good game!!!
"If I could rate minus stars, I would. I recently tried to save my progress by logging onto Facebook. It saved my levels, however all my boosters and gold bars vanished. I lost 2344 gold bars and over 500 various boosters. I want them back. Please help me retrieve what I had accumulated."
"It's the second time I have switched phones. The first time I lost all my progress,and now I lost my lives including progress. It's defies the perpose of saving progress via Facebook nor email.worst thing ever I even had booster 🙄😔ay bandla shame mind you I bought those boosters I did not win them 🥺 kanti how are you 😡"
"It's a really good game!there are no ads yessir! Not a single ad! At somepoint,I think it's a super hard game,but it's actually fun we who does not think that is not a good game? You better download it. It's just-mind blowing bruh. Well,that's all from my side."
It's easy at first but after lvl 100 the levels become unplayable where you lose all lives multiple days in a row to progress through one level. Playing becomes frustrating with levels that take a miracle to go through.
"I finally made a purchase to finish a hard level, I'm an over 5000 level player. Because of the purchase, I no longer receive free spins or the option to watch ads to get extra tries at the end of a puzzle. I don't recommend ever buying anything because you will have to continue buying to win levels. Big disappointment. No coincidence the last 5 star rating was in July!"
"After one purchase, the ads simply go away forever which makes it impossible to catch up or win anything. I keep getting stuck on levels every day and struggle to finish one level for sometimes a whole week. This sucks and has absolutely ruined my experience. Funny way to say thanks to someone who gave you money."
"I've been enjoying the game since I started playing it but recently I can't be involved in races anymore, I can't watch videos at the end of games to get free moves to complete the game and it's always saying it's my internet connection whereas it's not because my internet connection is good and works for every other applications on my phone. I would like if there's something that can be done about because I just updated it today and it's still the same"
"The app has been super glitchy. There's now been 2 times where I completed a level, the app froze, and canceled the win. My app is updated everytime this happened too"
Good going game really enjoying it has improved a lot with more free boosters. But in weekly prizes should be divided and given for all 3 competators. Look into it all boosters are given only for 1st position. We want boosters but not with time limit. The Ad's are long and we r getting bored to move forward in the game.
"I love candy crush a lot, it eases ones stress. It increases your sense of reasoning. The only issue i have is that those ads consumes data when playing. If only the time limits for the ads can be reduced. ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"Not as fun as it used to be, at all. Also, they've made the levels way too hard in turn forcing you to purchase items to win the levels. Too money hungry. Can't beat half of them without power ups, I've played some over and over and it gets boring after a while. There's way better games out there just like this that give you power ups without touching your bank."
"It's frustrating, you reach certain levels like I'm on level 5025 and I get stuck for a week, even the limited boosters don't help. It's not an easy game to play as your add suggests."
"Love this game! Those who may say it's P2W or there is a pay wall are wrong. I'm currently at level 293 and haven't spent a dime. Plus, they do a great job of giving you rewards to help you along, you just have to sit thru an ad that is anywhere from 5 to 30 seconds long. Just one ad per prize."
When you have less than 10 gold bar they will provide you so many chances to win a game. But when you have 10 or more gold bar that much chance will never show. Sometimes if we are close to win the game by getting just 1-2 chance they won't give us choice to see ad and get chance. Don't try to fool us.
"Generally fun, but low rating due to lack of any colorblind mode, which makes later levels (where shapes are the same) utterly unplayable."
"This game is fun, but still has it's problems. The main one being no way to get the only currency, gold, for free. You will always be forced into microtransactions."
"I got stuck at level 290. No way to pass without buying gold bar! :) I'm now frustrated and I'm going to uninstall the app. It's a paradox: win to get gold bar, get gold bar to win! So I'm out."
The is adventurous as it has unlimited stages... With my previous experience I was able to get stage 6432.but now I've lost my progress due to the fact that my previous phone broke off and I couldn't retrieve the account I registered with on the saga
The developers have changed the game into a money grab. Many levels have had the amount of moves drastically cut by less than half or a third of the moves that were needed to pass when the game was developed. What this means is that many l
"Enjoy it, mostly, but you get to the stage where it's obvious they want you to pay to get by a level I've tried Level 300 nearly 100 times and I've read that others have the same issue. Thinking of uninstalling, as I refuse to pay."
"Great game, except for when you can't win because it's not giving you the items you need to collect. Other than that the hearts take too long to revive, still a pretty good game though"
"I have really enjoyed this game until lately. Obviously levels get tougher, but you almost have to have power ups to get past a level which is annoying and I'm not going to purchase power ups. The thing that really has me ready to uninstall this game, is it keeps freezing on me. I play a few rounds and then it just freezes and the only thing I can do is totally close it down. If that continues to happen, I'll definitely be uninstalling."
"Really enjoy this app. I originally downloaded it to get paid thru an app, but keep playing because I like it so much. Would give 5 stars, but don't like how you have to pay for all the extras. I think you should be able to earn them."
I really enjoy playing candy crush I'm upset because I was on level 6 thousand plus. I had to get a new phone and my game didn't transfer. LOVE the game SAD I lost my progress. Also I have arthritis in both legs always in pain. Doctors recommend playing games to take your mind off of the pain FYI Yes it helps
"It's fun, and a bit addictive. Love the explosions, and the combination of the different thing's. It's fun. Didn't even download it lol, it downloaded itself 🤔but played it, and enjoying."
Game is boring now..i used so many golds but levels are so difficult to clear..other participate clear levels very fast even we try our best and used gold but the levels not clears. I play game when I'm stressed but now when i play the game I'm feels more stress. New players have new look in game but old player don't have new look in game even after update.. Please look in this matter otherwise i uninstall the game..
the amount of pop ups is so annoying. I have considered uninstalling the game. Just let me play the game without the constant pop ups. And they're not ads.
Get stuck so often. 😥 Can play on one level for weeks at a time without getting anywhere. Was suggested I uninstall and reinstall the game and all stored up boosters disappeared.
"It can get expensive but it is fun. Sometimes, rarely, you get a game that says you still have things to collect but it doesn't show you where and I can't find them. That can be very frustrating but it's rare. Game can be addictive!"
Hey y'all I thought the game got trash after the numerous updates it was getting but the lag was caused by sounds I disabled both sfx and music in addition to vibration and boom it was slick smooth 60fps gameplay (my phone has 60fps display)
"It's fun at first but they charge you 16 good bars and 10 gold bars to continue a game with only 3 or 5 moves, knowing that you won't clear the level because it's so hard."
"Im that person that absolutely refuses to spend money on apps that insist they're free to play. I highly recommend saving your progress and clearing the cache. Maybe even completely removing the app altogether from your devices periodically to progress with difficult levels. I constantly find myself stuck on even the so-called ""easy"" levels for weeks at a time, all the while in game pop up promos suggest I make purchase. It's definitely a rigged program. But stay patient. Don't buy anything!"
"I hate you, KING GAMES! Thanks to you, I have another addiction! And that really sucks because addiction is no joke! You are breaking my bank account, I know.... That's perfect for you! It's Sooo not good for me!!! It's only the first and I have to worry about eating this month! I wish this game would just up and disappear! Edit: 1st place in my division of semi-finals!! GO ALL STARS!"
"I have been playing for years and I mean years. But the last few days the game has been freezing, and when I do purchase things and spend the money for them the game freezes and I have to quit the game and all my stuff is gone completely! Either need the money back or fix the game please! I'll edit the review once someone reaches out"
It can be very addictive. This is the second time I downloaded the game but both the first time and the second time I downloaded it it froze at a certain level. I don't like that when you fill piggy bank or you earn rewards that you have to pay to get them. A free game should not have to cost you money no matter how much. I feel they try to tempt you promising you rewards that when earned end out costing you money to get them. This time the game froze twice. One more chance to fix it.
"Deleted at level 320. Tired of nightmarishly hard levels that, the further you go, seem less and less possible to complete unless you pay for extra lives/power ups/etc. Don't like feeling like my arm is being twisted to pay for a ""free"" game."
"I have re-download after years of not playing and I will be deleting after this review, this game has just become a complete money grab with back to back levels that are I would say impossible to beat without paying money for extra moves.. a game that claims to be 'stress reliever' then trys to rob you blind.. nice 👌"
"I love playing this game. For sure it helps in reducing stress when I cross levels with ease, but some levels also gives stress to me. Still it's very enjoyable."
"When this game was on Facebook we had more fun. because they had more osbtacle to challenge now in Android it's just clear de Jelly's and it's forcing you to see advertising in order to pass the levels , uninstalling this moment advertising ruining the fun of old-school gaming. What a shame. BYE BYE candy crush"
"I play this game just for fun and I love it. Yes, the levels are frustrating. But I think that adds to the fun of the game. I'd love to get more Candy Crush merchandise. I've not played this game for a long time. But since being off work sick with my mental health problem's, I've found it has been relaxing and has calmed me down."
"I like to play this game to pass time but, there were plenty of times where i bought boosters and did not receive them. I even reached out to customer service but they were no help. They just kept emailing me the same rules over and over instead of just applying my boostere themselves or refunding me. Customer Service Sucks!!"
"It is my humble request that you please stop this irritating background music and bring back original music, which was way better than this. Are you dumb or unable to understand.? Bring back old original music in game."
"Some of the game boosters don't work. Ring boost is one. After you watch the adds, you get nothing.i thought after a couple weeks they would fix it. It makes it very frustrating."
"I have been playing for almost 15 yrs. Recently changed my hp after 5 yrs but my boosters and lives collected over the years were not carried over to the new hp. Wrote to them and they say need to start all over again or use the old hp to finish up using the boosters and lives. I am disappointed, and I have decided not to play anymore. You just lost another loyal player. No point trying to collect as many boosters and lives. In the end, not able to use them when you change yr hp."
"From making some levels very difficult/impossible to pass to removing the ability to earn boosters on lower levels, King has taken the fun out of this game. I'm going to look for a different game now."
"I've been playing candy crush for years. Im on level 3346. I have accumulated many lives. How all of a sudden I am limited in the number of lives I can use daily. Like why!!!! I have to wait now, that sucks big time. People are going to start playing less if this issue isn't fixed. I guess I'll go back to playing spades."
The game is still good and enjoyable.the problem starts when I have to buy gold bars and bombs while I already use my data to play the same game. Lastly who took away the ads because we were getting lives there to finish levels instead of using 10 gold bars for 5 moves. Niyasikhuthuza🤧
"This game is no longer fun since they have removed the ""watch adds for booster"" feature. I've been stuck on the same level for over a week, and progress is no longer possible."
Since around August of last year nothing but crashes. I get all the streaks to have all the boosters and it crashes. In the last 15 min I have crashed 8 different times losing my streak boosters. Wth.
"Entertaining as usual. The scenarios keep pushing you to buy boosters and gold, but if you don't, just keep trying at the level until you woman's that's it, you'd keep playing..."
"The game itself is addictive but perhaps too much focus on silly storylines and just a number of clicks between games (not ads, just results menus and transitions). But all in all, good game. Never thought it would be quite as much fun Edit:- I'm having to reinstall the app as it freezes when I open it when it has been running in the background. i.e. If I've previously played and let the app and later want to play but haven't fully discarded it from the background apps (effectively minimize) 😖"
A game should be challenging without feeling impossible. This game causes more stress than it's worth. Where is the cherry on level 1278? I blew up the board multiple times and still no second cherry dropped. Really?
"We get given extra lives to play on with the numerous attempts to play on, but the levels are limiting moves each level, so difficult to complete. We cannot play on with the additional lives! As a player of many years I still hAppy to see the adverts to play on but boosters are dodgy as! They don't play their part correctly! I should be entitled to play when I want. I did not realise we needed parental control for adulting."
Quick game. Lots of color and whiz-bang explosions. Be careful though. Some of the blinking objects that can cause a quick response from your trigger finger are not always the best move to achieve a win.
"This game is so addictive that I can't just stop playing but nowadays this has become boring as I am on the hardest level the moves are so few that it is just impossible to clear the level without any extra help which I have to pay with the coins, that also doesn't work as I pay for it, coins are gone and helps are not given. Ridiculous , they say to check my server ,how is it possible rest of my apps are working perfectly only candy ask to check servers. I will delete this game😡😡😡😡"
"I'm starting to agree with a lot of the other reviews. As you get to the higher levels, the nightmarishly super hard levels come more and more frequently along with other very difficult levels back to back. And they are almost impossible to win ... even with using 3 boosters plus the watch a video ad booster. And I am adamant too that I'll never be paying to play any game."
This game is unnecessarily hard it has Way to much stuff that you have to get rid of with what little moves you have to work with and the power ups that is if you ever get any because bing able to get any type of power up at all is near impossible but if you do it help some that is when ever thay decide show up
"Fun, addicting game, but to win levels without complete frustration, purchases help. They aren't cheap either so this game can get a little costly, hence the reason I deducted one star."
"I am uninstalling this game after 10 years. I've reached level 4814, and after having a win streak of 80, I was cheated out of my win streak. This level needed me to drop 6 cherries to pass. Right towards the end, the 6th cherry would not release, even after paying to continue the level to have 5 extra moves, 4 times in a row. I've spent so much money on this game over the years. You're actually doing me a favour. I'm seriously disappointed, but I guess it is your loss."
"Games good but the ads, and the offered jammed in your face every level! There are more presses on the screen to get rid of all the suggested offers and ads, than you would need to finish some levels!"
Used to love this game when it was actually relaxing to play. Now every time I open the app there's a million different prompts trying to get me to purchase something. Which makes sense now that the ability to watch ads for extra moves and lives are gone. Games such trash now
Not fun..the game used to be fun until you get to a certain level then it's almost impossible to win the level and it's one after another! It also freezes on ads and almost forces you to buy bars or other crash bars so you can pass! The free gifts or lives after you watched the video never come..I had to reinstall the game just to get rid of freezing ads and lost all my candy powers!!!! Horrible
Not happy with recent update. Trying to be forced to purchase a 99 cent offer. Ad pops after losing a level and i cannot close the ad. I try and click the x to close the window and nothing happens. I can click the buy button and it goes to the 1 tap buy screen. I cancel that and I still cannot close the ad. Only option is to completely shut down game and restart it. Not happy.
"Took 12 gold from me when i purchased 1 life for 4 gold. If you do too well, it will literally work against you. On one level i was finally winning, it stopped giving me poppables- which i needed to finish. One one level, i continued after i lost and got 15 more moves, a few trys later and they only gave me 5."
"Hands down, the most boring matching game I've played. The characters are annoying and the gameplay is lackluster. Do yourself a favor and try literally any other similar game instead."
Played this game for over 10 years. Was good but now just a money spinner for King. Have uninstalled as I cannot progress without spending. The game is now frustrating and Boring. You only have to Google the game to find out it earns the most revenue.
"it is fun, the only thing that's irritating is when you freaking watch an add to regain or obtain life, the app would restart and it would freaking loose the current game and the watching of ads were off to waste. lol."
I am having fun and get to know and challenge new friends here.....wonderful! I would recommend Candy Crush to any one who wishes to have a go at it. It can be played with other users online. The game is challenging once you start you don't feel like stopping! Go 🍬
"I did enjoy the game in the beginning. I agree with a lot of the reviews on here.The higher you get if you don't buy boosters or other items you cannot beat the level, it's almost impossible. I don't want to pay to play a game.It gets way too expensive. Also, on the hard levels you lose all your lives and then you have to wait 30 minutes before you can play it again. Unless, you want to pay for lives. I'm thinking of uninstalling the game it's getting too pricey."
More than 10 times i have uninstalled and reinstalled due to stuck up with one level for than more than two days. Still i have not give up. Because game is so interesting. But the updated game js very tough. Booster is also very less.
"This last update has created a new issue with the game, when failing a level and it offering you a try again offer, you can't clear it to move onto retry the level. Clicking the cross doesn't do anything, I even tried buying the offer in the hopes that it wouldn't offer it to me again, but it still doesn't clear. You have to force quit the game and restart it, every single time you fail that level. King please fix this issue!!"
"I haven't played this game in a while and I miss some stuff like the owl levels and the story mode (that was just a comic at the beginning and end of the world, every 10 levels if you don't understand)"
"When i win a level , i don't go to the next level, or go to other levels i deleted this game twice before. But it's still the same. I played 4306 and won it , when i go to next it's 4298, why do you do this?fix it.if it get fixed the game is better much more....😑😒💟"
"I've downloaded this game again since the pandemic. & the game picked up where I left off at from. It was all good. Recently I had to uninstall to re-install because the game was freezing & I couldn't do anything. I LOST ALL OF MY BOOSTERS. This is very annoying because although I would sometimes spend 1.99 to buy some, I refuse to spend more than that to get me back to where I was. I will more than likely stop playing & encourage others to not even play. You don't even get extra moves anymore!"
"I love this game & how addictive it is. I have been a fan since the original. But if there's 1 thing I really, truly hate is when you have a piggy bank full of gold bars but you can't use them. You're forced to spend money & buy something that you already won. That's bs & makes me wanna uninstall."
"Level by level seems to bring new challenges. Even it gets tough don't give up, you can do it if you try!! Items hard but just keep trying, that's what I do."
"It's a great app and the game can be challenging but having got up to the 4000's now some of the games are absolutely ridiculous. Undoable in most cases unless you buy boosters. I know king or whoever owns this now, is not a charity and are trying to make money but they need to look at some of the levels to see that they're taking up to 2 weeks to solve. Just my opinion."
"What's supposed to be a calm fun game is actually just timed wins, like a slot machine. This game no longer requires skill, just boosters, ads, and repeated attempts. The game has forced win and loss streaks. If you fail on a level enough times it will just let you win. Also, if you're close to beating a hard level too quickly the candy will fall or use special candy to your disadvantage to prevent you from beating the level."
Still interesting it gets big tricky n takes a couple of days to pass some levels. I do buy help sometimes when I have used up the help I work hard for. But it is a bit much u really don't get enough for ur money . But I'm hanging in there for now..
"Definitely has a couple challenges but all.together a wonderful game and keeps my lay around, bored mood busy. No ads at all there is in app purchases but you do not have to buy them if you do not want."
"I like to play while I'm relaxing on my leisure time. Now, after a round of failing a level a window will pop up to buy boosters. No problem. However, when I try to exit out the window, the button is unresponsive. I restart the app and play and after failing another level the same window pops up to buy boosters. Again, couldn't exit out the window. CONVENIENTLY, the button to BUY boosters works perfectly fine. I don't mind buying gold when I WANT to but, feeling like its forced doesn't sit well"
I really enjoy playing candy crush..but I would be very happy if you update it with the remaining moves used for later stages.. according to the stock in the app .. If I am left with some moves in a particular stage.. kindly make an update to use them whenever I need them in any other stage.. Thank you..
"I love this game and it was doing all fine but, since a few days ago it keeps telling me that there is a server error and it logged me out of my account!! Although I have an excellent internet connection. I hope this problem is solved ASAP."
"I am also getting ads that I can't close out of without closing entire game. The recent updates with the microphones and extra graphics on pages are making it really hard to see what's going on in the game. I can't see the goal or how close I am in the top right corner, there's something that looks like a % sign covering it. Also the microphones look like keyes. Stop making all the crazy graphics or allow a setting for less graphics on screen for players with sensitive eyes."
It's fun but it's also kinda addicting when it comes to super hard levels it can take 40+ tries to pass it it's kinda hard to get gold and upgrades and when you do get them you have to use them on hard levels you cant just use it on one you're struggling with or you'll never pass the hard level that's upcoming
"Ridiculously small on my tablet. It used to be such a good game until someone had the awesome idea to make it so small you need binoculars to see it. Playing is less and less now, as its just too frustrating to see"
fantastic game there are a lot of challenges but it's an incredible game i just love candy crush i reach level 3000 and lost my game progress because it was not saved but with a positive mind set i hope to reach to that level again and with the boosters you get the little push .
Dont make any purchases. As soon as you do the games glitches and cheats players. Some of the candies you try and made won't be made and the moves you use to combine candies do not work sometimes. I feel like I been ripped off for paying for candies lives etc only for the game to purposely glitch and lose a round. On top of that it gave me no possible combinations for like the first 10 moves and I was not able to complete a round because the first 10 moves had barely any possible options. SCAM
Must we spend? Must we buy bonus packages? You're making this app very annoying and boring. Full of very hard levels without free ads to ad moves. Watching ads generates income for you. Isn't that enough. Subtle extortion is what I smell. I'm deleting. Nonsense
Overwhelming quantity of pop-up windows. The game sunk in some creepy stuff. But the last point for me was redirects in ads. The app allows itself to open different other apps
"CC used to fun. It's a waste of time every since they've restricted players to 20 gifted lives daily. Now with episode race, only 1st player gets gold bars. Everybody else, color bombs. I'm done and I'm well over level 10,000 and have been playing for yrs. Goodbye"
I was playing and spending money! I was the winner of the race and I was suppose to get my 45 gold bars! Guess what ! I got nothing! You can't contact anyone about it! It's sad cause I was winning! I just wished who ever control's this game cared for the people! Especially when they're spending there hard earned money! Wow
It says free to play but gets boring as sometimes a level goes on & on with no possible way of winning. I refuse to pay $$$ to get boosters to cheat and get to the next level.
One of the worst game available on play store. One one can win a single level on its own will Power...... Some level u win in just one or two move rest of level you can not win in 10 to 20 try.. very worst app.. plz solve all the problem available in the game....
Addictive and fun game. Frustrating at times but had the right balance to bring you back in to completing even the most difficult levels.
The game is programmed to make you loose your gold pieces and ultimately have to build them back even though it can speed up the process of clearing the board with one move so.
"My favorite game on android. 😁👍👍 2nd opinion here as of 2/2023. Still love Candy Crush Saga but....I can not stand that girl & the mouse that pops up with their sad faces & her peeking over at me with that look ""Really, you want to quit the game and not buy any specials""? each time I lose or pick the wrong Cinema hidden special. What's up with that? 🥴"
"When will you fix the frozen pop-up screen? It's extremely frustrating to have to close the app and open it again after every play. This pop-up appears when I open the app anyway, so why does it have to pop AGAIN up after I attempt a level? Why not just take that 2nd pop-up out until you can figure out the problem? Are you really going to lose that much revenue? WE JUST WANT TO PLAY!!"
"Decent game, great for killing time. But so shameless of trying to get you into micro transactions. Many levels are almost impossible without using pay to win strategies or waiting days to get one free and hoping rng is on your side."
The worst update I've ever made... I went from just playing candy crush to saga... there's a reason I never downloaded candy crush soda saga or whatever it was... the unneeded graphics when using special candies and now it takes me so much extra time just to be able to play a game instead of being able to jump on and play
"Bought candies using 8 gold bars, you didn't respond but you took my gold bars then again bought moves with 10 gold bars you took my gold bars and never responded again. This is very annoying kindly review your game. This is supposed to be an interesting game but you are making every moment stressful. I hope this rating finds you well and give me my gold bars back I need to use them now"
"Uninstalled Dec 2022...the number of completely irrelevant and annoying clicks that needed to be pressed after one level before going to the next did for me. Nothing to do with third-party ads, but worse. No I don't want to play mini-challenges outside the main game, no I don't care about finding Candy King's missing keys, no I didn't ask for friend requests, and so on. So thanks for the easy option to turn these off...oh, sorry there isn't one. Too bad, I took the next easiest option. Goodbye"
"They changed the classic sounds for new ones that honestly suck. They suck so much that I'm going to unistall the game because of them. One of the most satisfying things of this game was the sounds and effects it has when combining different candies, and they decided to get rid of that. The game hasn't been entertaining for a long time now, incredibly hard to pass any level without paying for more moves or gold. And now this? I guess they made too much money and they couldn't care less about us"
"What is the point of writing a game that gets so difficult and unplayable 🤷 There is no point, no enjoyment when being forced to play out the same level over and over. I'd rather pull my own toenails out. For that reason I've uninstalled it just like millions of others."
"Once you get past 10,000 levels it's ridiculous. You are given far too many things to do with 20 moves. Basically unless you pay you don't get anywhere. I won't be playing anymore. I'm not being forced to try and spend money. That's what you get for staying and playing the game is for them to just try and rip you off. Don't waste your time"
Uninstalled cause I got tired of having to keep spending money to get pass games after I reached 400 levels. Nearly every game had to spend money. I can't afford it. I'll go back to free games
"I love the game I crossed 2k level. I request the developer to show some leverage, I have been playing the same level for more than 10 days now, it is time for me to uninstall the app. If you think I'm not good enough, FYI I crossed 2k level. So please consider my request."
"This game is one of the most disgusting game i have ever seen from 4 days after being stuck on 364 level today when I was going to purchase extra moves suddenly game stopped and now my all gold bars are gone🤮🤮 think before you download it i really don't recommend this game creators instead of giving stupid updates try to resolve player's problem... GUYS, DONT DOWNLOAD IT.... Again automatically all my gold bars are gone 🤢🤢"
"I've played for a decade at this point. While I've loved how they've continued ro update and grow the levels (I'm 7100+ levels deep and still haven't run out), but the glitches have become frustrating. The daily wheel no longer works for me and reaching out to the help desk just gets an email suggesting the FAQs. I like the option to watch multiple ads for different extensions so you know what you're getting and that the ads are opt in rather than invasive like some games."
This game is no longer fun. Passing hard levels is impossible without boosters and those are available for a price. Deleting the game. King became greedy and ruined a good thing.
"When you com on 350+ level, you are stuck there for week. No way to pass out without money. For extra boost you must seen ad non stop. I have never seen free life from friends. 2 stars only because the game is super relaxed on the beginning."
Love this game. I stopped playing this game a few years ago because I had finished it. I now reinstalled it and started from the beginning again because of all the awesome updates and changes they have made. I am so addicted to this game because I like all the different challenges and it's never boring!
"Game is fun but earns low rating for being pay to win. Too often, puzzles are only solvable if you purchase more time or boosters. If it continues to be this frustrating, I'll probably uninstall."
Enjoying the game immensely. Only issue I have is on purchasing lives to continue on. Cost is a lot considering the amount of playing time and level up needed.
"Good until I can't accept lives sentidk how many lives accepted is the limit or how long the wait to be able to accept more lasts. I think this should be clarified better. So far it's been almost 5 hrs and I still can't accept more lives. This should be changed/fixed. Other than that, lots of fun and smooth interface."
Pretty entertaining! I don't mind the ads they are short and you're able to obtain boosters/extra lives for watching. Sometimes it does seem the system is rigged to make you lose. But either way the music is relaxing and it's an easy going time passing game. Still enjoy it.
The game is very boring now. Some level are just unbeatable. Can u believe am still stock in a level for more than a week now. If something is not done about this I will just get read of the game and download other Fruit crush game.
It's very disappointing. I pay 10 gold to get moves and then the game suddenly stops and I don't even get back my gold. Your game service is very bad. Look into it.
"Addictive. But annoying. Make one swipe and it can finish the whole level for you. Cool at first, but frustrating after a while. Too many pop ups."
Fun game but sometimes we need just 1 extra life. I've earned the gold bars why must I pay to use them. I will never purchase help in a game I'm enjoying it but still not sure why I have to pay to use what I have earned. I'm liking the watch ad to earn free games
I just want to play Candy Crush. I'm waiting for the game that comes up that won't let me play anymore until you want me to spend my money. I'm not spending money I am just playing the game. I have deleted this game and the past. I will do it again when I get to that one game that you give me only 15 moves to get an impossible amount of things or the puzzle is just set up that it is just impossible to wins.why do you have to make it about completion?
"This new update is really rubbish. This is not the candy crush I used to know. And what's up with all the ""extreme"" hard levels? It's not like we're gonna win real money after a particular stage. I just use this game to pass time... I'll have to uninstall and delete all data if it gets any harder"
The game is fun and interesting and there are lots of events and challenges which makes it more fun but the reason I'm giving four stars is because I think friends should be able to share gold bars the way we are able to share lives.
"You should bring back the rewards. The biggest item that is needed is gold bars to give you extra turns at the end of the game. The rewards were based on people spending money on your game, everyone has a rewards program. Bring yours back!"
"The game is totally satisfying . when I play the game Then when I listen to the song that is in the game, I do all the work that we do all day and then when I play the game, I feel like the fatigue is gone a little bit and I am getting a little relief.So I thank the leader of Candy Crush Saga Company for making such a beautiful game for us . And I want to tell the company that if the song is a little more satellite, it would be great."
"I won the race for first position, and I got forty gold bars. I came back to the app today and saw a notification that I had lost the race and would have to start from twenty gold bars again. Please fix this, or I may stop playing."
"Am losing interest in this game because after watching advert the game will go off and i'll have to reload the game with no reward. You're just wasting my data, i'll disable it if it continues that way."
Starts off as a fun game but after the beginning levels becomes a shameless cash grab. Levels are purposefully designed to need special purchases in order to pass them. Would not recommend.
"Getting more and more disgusted with this game lately. It used to be a fun diversion but anymore it is a pay-to-win scam. Levels that are ""normal"" can't even be beaten without rewards and there are way too many pop-ups between levels trying to get you to buy things. This game just got to be too much of a money grab for the developers so I'll be deleting it after years of having it on my devices."
"THE ISSUE JUST CONTINUES!!!! On the verge of uninstalling 😡😡 Updated review..... FIX THE BLACK SCREEN FOR WATCH AD MOVES!!!!!! RIDICULOUS!! PLEASE fix the issue of when you watch ads to claim moves, a lot of the time the ad will just be a black screen and stay that way, you will then have to completely close out of the game!!!! It is so frustrating as this has wasted so many lives and moves knowing you could have finished a level if not for the black screen!!"
"I have been playing this game more or less since it first came out (10years?) and I'm level 8285. I love this game because you can dip in and out, it's varied, and the colours are lovely. It's competitive too! Yes, the higher you get, the harder it gets. That's to be expected, right? You can spend money if you want but if you're savvy and play regularly you don't really have to because there are loads of little games and challenges that win you rewards to help you pass the tricky levels."
"Game is fun for the most part, but my biggest complaint is lvl 40. It is just bad lvl design. The way it is set up to be played, it basically plays it self. If the striped fish fire in the right direction you have to try really hard to lose but when they randomly fire in the wrong direction, you lose before it is possible to make a single decision for yourself. Also the threshold for the sugar stars makes me feel like I'm playing slots and hitting the jackpot is as likely as winning the RL lotto"
"Should be renamed ""Watch lots of long adverts to progress"". Really boring... I have stopped watching the endless 30 second adverts and guess what - I've not progressed 1 level for 2 weeks! Why would anyone play this?"
"Why the app store is eror after I buy something, and I'm not getting the item until now. I paid it by VA.. And because that eror I can't get more chance from watching videos after I lose... It's only loading and there is nothing.. I play the other version of this game and nothing wrong with their app store... I did uninstall and re-install this game some times, also reboot my smart phone but no help... Please help me..."
"Hey, I recently swapped phones, I used smart switch which moved all accounts across to my new phone, however when I used my login & password to Candy Crush, all my inventorys had gone. I have had to recently pay again to get some back. However, please can you look at my past history & reinstate all my inventory? I had lots, over 100 for just the candy wheel alone.. yet now since swapping my phone I have under 10. surely my account should stay with my logins, thank you....!"
"Video ads don't give you extra moves more times than they do. Will watch the video and after watching it will say video not available and not give you extra moves. On latest update I lost the back button, have to swipe up to find it. Seems like the zoom is off. Get stuck on screens between levels and have to exit and close game, sometimes even force stop."
"It hangs then stops. I'm on level 4314 and it stops. Have to start over again. Been playing a level for days even weeks. Why? Because it stops. And it's annoying when you're about to finish a level...and boom! IT STOPS!! UPDATE... Same annoying problem. After watching the ads for the 3rd time, again it stops. Free booster gone. Have to start from the beginning. Life gone. Repetitive.. if I could only slap my phone to your faces, I would... UPDATE... Level 4690. Another stupid level... tsk.tsk.."
"Really good game, I have passed 4000+ levels. But there is an issue thatif I want to play the previous levels, I have to scroll down a lot and I cant get to the level directly. Please add an ipdate to reach the desired level directly."
"It has been the best android game have ever played it's fun with amazing features and challenges ,I recommend it for primary school students to enable them think outside the box to solve problems of their class work."
Three consecutive levels of hard level and the fourth one is a super hard level. Can you please put some intervals to the hard levels and super hard levels. Thank you for your kind consideration.
"Now is the time to try without hints if you're advanced enough Even if you have tried for awhile, use your better judgement. You can do it just take your time and skills you have learned. For me this is easier nothing telling me what to do 😂. Try it good luck."
Too frustrating. Need gold bars and they make darn sure you have to use all you have so you have to buy. Got better places for my little pension check. So looking for a relaxing game that doesn't require you to win in 15 tries to get 300 pieces.
"Up until the latest update, I would have given a 5 star. Love this game and everything about it. But now the boosters won't show. its just blank circles and the game freezes in between levels, having to close the app and reopen in order to play. I have done everything that Google and King has offered suggestions on to fix this but no luck. Please help!!! I want to play Candy Crush!!!"
I've been playing the game for about a week so far. I really seem to enjoy it so far some of the levels of when a little tough took me a little bit to get over but I finally got through them and I know it's gonna get harder but I have never played candy crush until now and it's pretty fun
The bombs are terrible. Sometimes we have to use all of moves chasing them. The game is to help us relax. Sometimes you try to set yourself up for a great move and the game robs you of that move.
It's my favourite game ever. When I always bored thise is my partner in good and bad time. It is challenging game ever. Any one who play this game they know how it thoughtfulness and hard some time. My friends also help me to beat levels in ccs.
"Diff. Phone, having to start over, I didn't backup the game. I do enjoy the challenges this game gives you. It can be fun a frustrating at the same time."
I love this app it's such a adrenalin rush for me. But I love it and I love the allstars. Very awesome that we actually get a chance to win alot if cash. Keep up the awesome work and special features for this app. Your doing a good job.
Nice sound effects...but the music is too old...they need to switch it up...lol...and the print is too small for us old folk...I can't see nothing hardly.
Somewhat challenging but if you don't rush and use logic the levels can be accomplished. Also fun and rewarding.
"The game is really equipped with a lot of fun ""mini-games"" or more like challenges. It's really therapeutic, and weirdly addictive. It's the best!"
I love the game but I was on over 700 stages done and had to start over. I would have been ok with it had it happened because I switched phones but it didn't. So I'm working on Candy Crush from 1. I still love the game ***** stars.
"Cannot redeem amazon prime gaming reward, qr code does not result in any action from the name. Provide a coherent user experience or don't offer anything via prime. I almost started playing again, but this is getting uninstalled."
It's good fun I'm enjoying it very much I can't put it down so good I hope I can get further on it I had to take it of it was freezing all the time I'll see what it does now that I've loaded it back up it seems ok it's still working since I loadedf it back in it is a great game as long as it works so far so good I'm enjoying the new bits of it hope new bits get added soon still playing it it's really good still playing it from the beginning alot started it again it froze again so doing it again
I like this game it's fun and i can play it for an hour or so i like reaching levels getting the golden bars etc. All i can say is that i like this game and you should download it if you like a challenge from time to time.
"Love it, it's fun and time consuming when you're bored. Only thing is theres so many of the new offer ads that pop up which are annoying"
"After playing many games very similar, but not the original, I finally got around to Candy Crush, and Yes, it's a lot of fun! Really enjoying all the great power-ups."
Game is fun until you're in higher levels. Get 19 moves and simply no way to complete without paying money which apparently is the whole point. The obstacles just to complete take up more than half the moves. Nothing left to actually clear the board joke
"Game play is great but so many god damn auto-pop-ups for offers and about 7 useless ""congrats you did this"" screens at the end of EVERY level that could be displayed all at once instead. And I'm not going to buy that stupid piggy bank! Stop offering it!"
"Five-star all the way I want to go play so I can't stay. LOL it's an awesome game you have to use your brain but you'll like. it so cool to use my brain, you'll like it's cool. You're missing out if you don't check it out. The first question says is this a real Prodigy game I don't know what that even mean dude. I had to edit this twice I'm so glad I read it after I posted it I think I said I don't know but I got to go I like candy"
"Interesting pay-to-play game. Once you run out of lives, there are plenty of other candy crush like game apps to play while you wait for this app to generate more lives. Switching between multiple candy crush games means you can progess in all of them without down time."
"Updated app and have lost more games and bonus pops. It does allow you to finish commercial before cut off. Gain bonus, never received."
"I have changed my review because 😊 i have came to love the game. But please just reward us something on "" Climb the tree"" because at times i feel cheated after trying almost every time and coming out with nothing...😣. Please fix the bug in the last update"
The earlier levels are ridiculously hard and too many of them!! You feel forced to buy the boosters to complete a the game.. You should be able to use any of the boosters that you have accrued and not the one's you are forced to use.. Candy crush sadly has gone down hill 😕
"I like the game. The thing that I dont like is that sometimes, they give us barely any moves like it's almost impossible to win. I just want to get like 3 more moves every time"
this game sucks . I won the weekly race twice in a row on the 3 row won but they showed that I lost and kicked me out of the row. I already should have the boost but their didn't give me . I'm not playing this game anymore
"It's a go-to, all time favorite. Challenging and enjoyable!, At age 79, my vision starting to fall a bit, I win enough to enjoy the game."
"Bad experience ,I made a purchase of 10 bars each time for three times in one day ,the money was charged all three times but not a single bar was given to me ...i have been charged 3 times ..please look into it or refund my money in my account"
"I thought the game was not for me, mostly because I play more dramatic games. But this game has definitely gotten my attention! I find myself playing candy crush saga more and more. Good stress relief, good fun. Overall a good game."
"It's good relaxing game, but when it hits hard,superhard and nightmarish level back to back it becomes an headache. I won 37 bars of gold and had 19 bars yet its only 37 reflecting what happened to the 19 ???????"
I like that it challenges me to slow down and think about the moves I need to make. It's a great game for a bit of down time or to use for transitioning between activities.
"Love the game, but the latest update wiped all my stuff. I had just spent 200 gold on special moves, now they are all gone. I also had around fifty lives saved in my mailbox, also gone. My friend agent showing up."
"Just a classic that never gets old. Download it just to see what all the hype is about and now I can't stop, the challenges and competition aspect is the most fun."
Candy Crush has lost a lot of its fun factor and become more frustrating with some levels and their constant attempts to sell you extras to get past difficult frustrating levels.
Its so annoying ane irritating when we stuck in one level . Its becomes boring 😖 . There should be some changes make levels little bit easy
Lovely and enjoyable game so keep it up with this game and that's the only game I play the most and thanks again. I'm happy to be part of candy crush's fan. Thank you for this lovely game ❤❤ New level and they are very challenging and hope you will bring back some advertisements again please they are very helpful ❤️❤️❤️
Having levels that you absolutely have to spend gold to beat is ridiculous and greedy not to mention the game forcing you to only move the pieces it highlights is extremely annoying
"Candy Crush has always been a favorite game of mine and a way to destress for the day. I highly recommend Candy Crush Saga for anyone looking for a fun game to play while your bored, to take up some time or as a destresser. Really I have no complaints 😌"
I love candy crush although it's tough to win but there's an opportunity to get more heart or get extra moves and my only problem is whenever I failed a level and watch adverts to get extra moves .. going back to my game becomes a problem it's either I'll start over again or my candy crush app will start over and I'll loose my moves I got from the advert I watched but besides that I love candy crush ..my best game💖💖❤️
"I love conquering the levels at a high rate of speed. I love stock piling all my goodies for when I need them. I HATE using them all up, only having ONE MOVE LEFT and being forced to either, pay or give up and lose my high staus."
Some level are too hard but the turn number so less need update and new update in the level so jelly finishing the brush remove so again jelly appear so its not good . some level are hare but the move so less
"I don't understand how you can receive the chocolate candy ball and immediately run out of moves before you get the chance to use it, I like the game, but I'm not gonna pour my money into it just to keep playing because, I'm seeing a pattern of losing the game when I legit know I had another move to make."
I enjoy this game but the pop up to buy gold every time you move on to a level is annoying and unnecessary. Please remove this on your next upgrade.
Very worst game... First 100 levels very easy to play... But after the 100 levels it must be very hard and could not play without ads
It's a really good game I'm having a great time playing this game. I'm doing great on this game it's really challenging and fun to play I have found some really challenging games to play and I have passed every one of them but it really takes looking for the right moves
Took the time to fill in the survey on here for ads. 2 days ago. I have had 1 ad to get a gift. Taking into account all the other's I've had over 2years is a grand total of ONE. THAT'S ONE. ONLY WANT YA MONEY.. IT'S STOPPING ME GIVING LESS STARS NOW.. SHAME ON YOU
Turned this game into a scam. I have played one level over 70 times. Impossible to win without paying extra moves. Will never spend another penny on the game . ITS A SCAM!!!!
This game is so fun. I love the graphics AMD absolutely love that we can find new friends that play the game instead of bug the people you know. That's a plus for me!
The game is very good and satisfying. Some problems are there when i passed about 14 th level. The game said that can't play without friends. I just deleted it.
Please put this on Xbox Series X/S console and PC as a full Xbox Console Exclusive. I want to play this special tournaments with my friends for winning a free Candy Crush Saga All-Star DLC gaming chair in the future for putting on player's gaming PC station. I'm little disappointed that it not on Xbox.
"I downloaded candy crush wayback 8yrs i think . But i quit playing like 5 yrs or so 😆 and still each time i play, i am bored. Do something please like we can play with other players like 1 on 1 😆 2 moves per turn 2 rounds jusy like that! Beat match masters :D"
3 game over screens to both guilt you and force you to buy stuff. Along with levels you can't pass unless you also buy stuff. What utter nonsense.
Blah. They make it hard once you get so far...butttt I'm always coming back!!!! I'm baaack Super stoked to be back at it. Hi! I am having fun with this!! Learning something new every episode I'M BAAACCKKK!!!!!! READY TO TAKE THIS THING OVER Y'ALL ☺️
Have reinstalled several times.. it seems the better you are the algorithm makes the game harder and the boosters harder to earn..you need friends to get additional free lives
"I was not getting ads for extra moves, so i decided to uninstall the game and reinstall it, but my progress was saved but all my boosters got vanished, this is so annoying so i am deleting this game 😡😡😡😡😡😡"
"Love this game, but once you start getting to the hard levels, it's next to impossible to pass them without buying something to help."
Best game ever made. As most King games are. But most times watching ads shuts game down losing a life as well as rewards. As it now has doing this review. 😔
I just want you to know that no one can finish this game unless they use their money to buy coins. That is greed and deceitful. And no fun at all. Atleast make the levels easier or something.
After I have passed out 8000 level. No ads are there for extra moves and rewards. This makes me boring playing this game. And now I m playing another game also along with this game.
Add something like 'requesting a friend on the friend list to help pass a level' Maybe 2 requests for a day to a friend who has passed the difficult level I'm requesting for.
"Once you have bought anything in the game, then after that your ads will stop coming. After that they force you to purchase to pass the level. It's a very bad game now.Shame on the Candy Crush Saga team"
Its a fun game. Some levels are really hard to pass without buying boosters but the option to earn them by watching videos helps.
Hey Candy crush I'm a 9130 level player... I really don't like the concept of Candy Royal.... Throwing one's pic is unacceptable. Pls change that. That's the reason I never opt candy royal but some times it's happening with out my knowledge.
"Rigged on so many levels. Literally impossible to win without paying, and after you pay for bonuses, the levels mysteriously don't use them. Rip. Off."
This game really helps me relieve a lot of stress. It's s fun game and it keeps me focused on how to control my feelings most of the time. Thanks for being there ☺️ candy crush🍭 🥰...
"I dont think I've ever played a match 3 that you dont earn SOMETHING for passing levels, even getting 3 stars on each level nets you absolutely nothing🤦. Thankfully I'm only playing thru a pay app so I wont be here for long 😁"
It is very fun but I don't think we should pay a lot of money for our prizes or a little CANDIes that we buy or we could. Have better deals thank you but it is a fun game in a dictive.
Finding it hard to pass levels especially without watching videos to get extra moves or lives ..more gold bars need to be added takes forever to get one
You can't get added helpers... been on same level 6 weeks... tired of it. Also when you beat Rancid you should be able to continue getting points if you still have plays. Fix your game like it used to be!
"Fun, so addictive. Love the challenges xx Best game ever Brilliant Love it. I liked the different layout, like it was on a rotating road. love the new rewards 😌"
"Ads are not showing, its difficult to cross the level without it. We are struck in the same level for weeks. Pls help and provide the ads"
"Pretty pleased here. I don't often have money to play with, so if I have to wait to lives to refill, that's ok, and this app (so far) isn't horribly pushy about it. Thank you. I can live with that!"
"I wish it was more ways to win free boosters & gold bars, that's my reason for giving 4 stars because some people don't have money to pay for a game all the time I see sometimes."
The graphic is great im editing my review the new design and map is awesome and the levels now easy enough to win I was waitng for this balance thank you so much!
"I enjoy playing the game, but some of the levels seem to be impossible to pass. I've been stuck on a level for three weeks so I don't play as often. But, overall the game is okay."
"Why can't you use points to help win gold bars? Too many ""nightmareously hard levels"". App does not have very many glitches, only occassionslly."
Very nice game Help me relax and kill some time. Difficulty level increases slowly makes it more interesting. Hopefully I will also rake in some bonus.
"It's good but it glitches enough that it'll make me lose all my streaks that's I earn. Other then that, it's fun. Just need to make it quit stalling all the time"
"Changed from 5 stars. Had to reinstall as it had got glitchy (wheel spin) & lost everything except progress. Boosters, Lives, side game progress etc."
"Fun, mind numbing at times and some levels feel like you need to pay to pass. But luck is a thing, and the game is still fun."
"Use to play it daily, but now the start-up is filled with unwanted advertisements that slow down the game. Take away the ads, and then I'll be back"
It's very satisfying bt when it comes to hard levels and you can't afford to upgrade then you stick there for a week Would you please make it Abit simple
It's designed to definitely make you spend money . You basically need money just to clear a board you have to keep purchasing boosters and gold bars 🤑🤦🏽‍♀️
"It's nice and interesting as well as makes you think, just wish there were easier ways to know what to do to 3star some of the maps."
The game is pretty good. I just wish that there would be more opportunities to get gold bars because it is hard to save them for times when you're in need.
"Very difficult to clear level's, if we spent money to purchase gold bars they will deduct money but wont send back.. And there is no reward or ad's for gettings Lives and rewards for this"
What ever happened to games having a slight competition between scores on apps because I've had some very good scores but the game doesn't bother showing who has the top 3 scores
"Some levels are stupid hard and virtually impossible without making a purchase. Other than that, its fine."
"I'm disappointed, I've loved this game for years. Now it's getting harder to play if you don't spend money when you're stuck. You get so caught up with the game that you don't want to give up,so you spend the cash just to move to the next one and it's even harder. It's a catch-22. I will most likely uninstall."
"This game is really relaxing, however, some levels feel like they are outside of the category they are put in (ex. There is a really hard level in a regular category or an easy level in a hard category)"
I've already bought boosters twice since last week and today. After the payment I didn't get any booster at all.. I don't know where to confirm this issue at all
I am a good player and love this game. this game shut down i lost all of the winning streak and progress waiting on a ad to close game slowed down and shut down. Has been updated not playing this game is cheating
Extremely boring pleae gix the bugs and it gets Extremely easy when it tells you where to go make its more harder for the starters so they learn for the next levels.
"You have to add friends to continue the game when you run out of lives, first time u wait like 10 min. The second time 30, or you can buy lives. That is stupid to wait that long. I'm gonna stick with scrabble."
"My earlier progress was not retrieve, showing logging error from last 2 days . What is the problem behind that . As I had uninstalled it and download again but same problem occur"
"I am playing this game from many years and I am near level 1800 but now they are forcing to buy extra things to clear the level, this will only lead to uninstalling the game, bcz there are many games like this."
They have removed watch ad for more moves feature and now everyone is stuck on that one level for weeks. Now they are forcing everyone to pay to buy more moves otherwise you can't progress.
Have been playing king games for years. 🤩 Love them.took a break for about a year to explore some new favs I found. I'm going back to my roots a little old school.
"The game is good but too many breaks/srories/scores and rankings bwtween games. Also, too many things pop up for in game purchases."
Fun game racking up points. only problem is having to buy so many boosters!! Really like this game...but don't like to have to buy so many expensive boosters!
Loved game up until new update..... Can't get or connect with Facebook friends 🙄 have tried uninstalling and all the other stuff absolutely gutted. Recent update Absolutely love game even putting with ADs and enjoying benefits
I always enjoyed playing candy crush. It makes you use your brain and the candy looks so good that it makes you want to eat it. It's a very fun and interesting game I love it give it a try you'll get hooked
Needs to be more consistent across all devices.why do you not get the same bonuses etc on all devices.this is frustrating.or the same in game special themes/levels getting harder seriously this becoming a rip off u just want people to spend more and more and more money why have I lost sweet cinema. it's expensive and becoming a joke .the cost to get of levels is scandalous 😤🙄🤔😡ripped off considerably😗
Levels are fun without being too difficult so far. I love the graphics on this game! It's a great distraction
"The updated version rocks with plenty of challenges, gifts and very hard levels keeping you on the edge of your seat. I really love it"
"They replaced the old soundtrack with this bland and boring soundtrack. The last one sounded fun, and was so nostalgic. I can't believe they replaced it."
A game I come back to every now a then. Love it but sometimes the levels can be extremely hard but all and all it's a great game.
"Fun as well as frustrating ,but I love to play and try and beat others, not too well at the moment, but I hope I can beat someone 😂frustrating"
"Just because I want to save my progress I lose 91 gold bricks. I had just won 45 in a race then I lose everything because I saved it, your game sucks!!"
It's very tough after 5000 levels. I am not getting ads or boostes. Now I am feeling bored because Levels playing so many times.
I never ever loss once the app refresh to the main screen out of nowhere it's happen approximately 7 times I'm now downloading the app on another brand new device this aswell as the previous is popular new age very reliable device I'm so upset the app has no contact information
Do NOT make any purchases. As soon as you purchase they take away your adds and you can no longer get free moves or boosters. I do not enjoy this game as much any more
"This app encourages you to buy certain items to help you pass levels and therefore becomes addictive. Apps like this should be banned as it does nothing for those who have a gambling addiction, the developers of this app know this and have made it impossible to pass certain levels without spending money. Please be aware before you install this game. Apps like this have been designed to make this game addictive and make money for greedy developers. BOYCOTT ALL APPS LIKE THIS."
Can easily become pricey. Best to wait or try levels many times. Fun to play though.
"Every level is a nightmare. Game is boring. Lost all my collections - coconut wheel, color bombs etc.. While opening."
I didn't get my weekly bonus and the game told me reinstall the game and not delete. How do you reinstall without uninstalling? I lost all my progress and have to start from level 1.
I don't have a experience yet because they need to get to my ringtones first. I have a crazy sister that's meant to me you the tries to pretend. She's been to the ill observe. She's very obnoxious. I need this ringtone she is bugging the hat on me. Emma. Is her name And she's in my contact.
I like all the events of this game but Candy Royale's term of condition i don't like it... when i challenged 99 people and I play my self bt why this game cut gold bar every level I crossed.... after I played my self then why shouldn't I get 500 gold bar after I completed Candy Royale. This is disappointing me otherwise all events are fun..... if I completed Candy Royale event and I will get all 500 gold bar then i will be happy.
"This game is so annoying why can't you give me more moves to go how can you be giving me 15 moves in a hard task and it will not be found in the game, I hate this game 😡😡😡it doesn't relief stress it gives stress"
"This is a really nice game. However, I feel that if I pay for more moves I should get to keep those moves for later on in the game. Not lose them."
I had to get a new phone and now I don't get to spin the wheel nor get anything for that matter...the higher the level the harder it is to beat a level so I'm about done playing this game
Hard level are literally hard to pass having only few moves making it impossible to pass it with one or two try.
Fun and addicting. The thing that should be fixed is there are too many pop ups for what's going on or for you to buy something.
It's great game to play when your home 🏘️ or on the go when you have a few minutes to pass on the bus🚌 this game will take your mind off of the ride. Cool game I like it a lot just play it you be hooked to 😃
I love this game! There are all kinds of new stuff! Characters are cute. I like the different colors too. It helps to pass the time during these trying times. Thank you! : ). I still love this game.
I like this app a lot it relieves my anxiety and is really calming I play it whenever I can and it's super fun! there is tons of quests you can do and there's never nothing to do in candy crush
It's fun and it make me want to pass more stages. I love racing to the finish first. It reduces stress.
Hopeless game. No information for new candies...levels are too hard and no information about how to play new level. I am not getting clear it since 2 months
It's fun eye pleasing and really addictive I love this game for it's colorful attributes and vibrant ways to play the star system makes me want to get the most stars I can which just keeps sucking me in to play more no complaints though I do love this game
I love the game i just love it. Nice control over ads👌👍. Just keep up the good work. I love ur cool and slow jazz it's really relaxing 💖
I somehow lost all my progress and went to level 1 without me deleting all my progress! How do i get my game back? It happened after the last updated and game keeps showing me bugs..
Fun game and enjoyable. A relaxing game. Interesting. Wonderful. Great. Enjoy. And 😊.!! Addictive. Less stressed.!!!! Less stressed.
You can play the game without ADs but I hate that they're so integrated in the game. Also running out of stars and having to stop or ask me for - meh...
"It's fun, but there are WAY too many pop up notifications. If I want to check my chocolate box after one singular level, I have to X out of 5 different in-game messages. Sometimes I have to exit twice from the next level start pop up. As of recently, I have to completely exit the game to get rid of the helper owl pop-up on level 540 when I want to retry. The X button doesn't work."
No matter if im just looking for a way to pass the time or if im dead set on owning some grannies on the leaderboard its a great game and i love ignoring people im hanging out with to crush candies.
"Fun. I like it. But, it would be very interesting if you add an option where we can discuss with our Candy crush's friends. 🤩"
I have so much fun playing the time goes to quick every level is exciting and challenging to play.
I've been enjoying this app. It makes you think about the best way to win. Very relaxing and nice playing this game to just unwind after a busy day!! No problems with the game.
Just started playing two days ago and I'm pretty good at it but something levels are very difficult specially cause I don't buy extra candy's I just use what I win.
"Robbed!! On the chocolate box, for the FOURTH time when it's time to collect my rewards after completion, conveniently is says ""error"" for the server. As much money as i spend on this game, this is complete BS. Especially for such a menial reward. Your packages are already sky high. STOP ROBBING PPL FOR REWARDS THEY'VE EARNED!!"
"I love this game But ur damn Ads r waay too long!!!😠😠. After every move I make, a 30 second ad comes on! They r just annoying becuz they're too bloody long!!!😠😠 AGAIN, YOUR ADS ARE TOO BLOODY LONG!!! NOT WORTH PLAYING!!! 😠😠😠😠 I've decided to uninstall this game, because of the ads And because the level I am on is just too difficult. Not worth it!!"
Like game don't like the new changes to the chocolate boxes though. Hard enough to save boosters for levels when we need them. I hope they go back to the way it was before...
"Several times my gold bars have vanished. After chking on the site I logged out and in, reinstalled the app but no avail. Ctc support which advised bogus about boosters and lives. My boosters were still there and fine. It's about my gold bars, your currency. Get that fixed and give me my bars back. Oh, and don't advise to ctc your useless support again."
"Some of the levels were way to hard and you have to spend money to pass them. Fun game, cute characters"
"They had a bug in Android for the last few months, and it is still not fixed. Their bypass: shutdown the phone for 10 seconds and restart 😡"
"This is like ALL the playstore games. Easy at beginning and then the levels become hard to the point that they almost cannot be completed. All games on playstore use this tactic to make players pay-to-play and force ads on you. DO NOT PAY for ""extras"" on ANY playstore game. Time to ban all playstore games"
Your customer service sucks you send a auto response and ask if it covers problem i said no and i get a email asking how was the customer service you recently provided. 1 only cause i cant put 0 or a negative. Not to mention things blowing up that dont get hit by nothing like the color bomb and it happens to stop people from levelin up to quickly but it still cheating us as players and reason i quit years ago!! Why do things blow up and not hit by anything. Still nothing weeks later your idiots
Wow. Just wow. Think you could make levels harder? Doubt it. This is what makes people delete games. Five in and I can't beat the level because the way they fall. Frustrating isn't the word for it. Bye
"Been playing candy crush for a long time now but recently it got alot of glitches whenevr I am about to win 72 gold baars or I am on a streak game will stuck or some other isse will occur like the ingrdients wont come ,now also i list 100 gold bars coz of this stupid glitch this is so unfair ..I feel like been cheated as if we are about to win huge amout of gold bar something will go wrong !!"
"The game is good and fun but at times it feels like being stuck at some levels is intentional, even the ad option is denied when you are almost done. 😥😪😓"
"Fun game that constantly evolves with new difficulties the higher you go on the game map. Keeps things new and exciting. Play it, you'll like it."
"Used to be fun, played for many years, on level 13,543. Been there for weeks. Also, lost a large amount of boosters that I had collected over months, customer service refuses to respond."
Great game fun and the characters are hilarious. Must think 🤔 about strategy and how to clear as many as possible with one shot.
"WOW, This is fun! I'd like to be able to make the rest of the moves after collecting all of the candies required. It's not as easy as you'd think. Wish I could could purchase helpers! Bummer"
New things coming up. I like it. Really enjoy this game. Awesome. Need more boosters. I love this game. A real challenge on higher levels. Thank you for pulling me out of that stage because it was hard to get all the chocolate to come up. Keep my mind younger. Awesome!
"I love the game, but on hard levels, I don't understand why it can take up to a day to pass. That's with extra help. I know it's not supposed to be a win every time, but not that long. I know many that have stopped playing because of this issue 😒 😑 🙄"
"Very interesting, improves puzzle solving capacity and mathematics. One can relax from daily problems and tension. Improves reasonability."
"Annoying. Is it necessary to have the piggy bank of 30 gold bars pop up before every level, I mean I know it's there I don't need to be reminded of it each and every time, getting close to moving on from this game"
My experience is like no other absolutely brilliant all the way . I'm so looking forward to more thrilling and challenging levels
Wish there was not so many ads to receive boneses. Wish there wasn't as many ads. Hopefully that will COME SOON. Great game for relaxing and anxiety issues. Thank you.
"LEVEL 1462 IS SO HARD I TRIED IT FOR LIKE 2 HOURS EVERY DAY! BUT STILL I CAN'T BEAT THAT LEVEL IT'S BEEN LIKE 5-6 DAYS, AND ADS I ALWAYS GET ARE OF 30 SECONDS WHICH MAKES IT EVEN ANNOYING🤬🤬BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT IS ALSO GOOD 😀. IT IS SOO PEACEFUL UNTIL YOU ARE STUCK ON THE SAME LEVEL FOR A WEEK!!!!!"
"Game is way too hard, so much so it's not fun anymore. I used to play a long time ago but now they've made it where they want you to spend money beat levels. I'm not spending money on a game. If it's not fun to play without spending money it's not worth it"
I have been playing for a little while on this phone. On my other phone about level 285. Great game. The newer version you can not make fish. Miss that
"Addictive and a fun way to pass the time, always adding something new and makes for great stress relief too."
I am totally losing interest like so many mistakes on this game if they think I'm spending money when they have control of this game no not spending any more money I am on level 6088 been here for two and a half months on this level. What bunch of greedy %^&%.
I downloaded this specifically to leave a review about how absolutely annoying the ads for this game are. Did you really need to make it necessary to click off the app FOUR DIFFERENT TIMES to clear out 1 ad?
I LOVE THIS GAME! The Developers of Candy Crush are always upgrading and integrating new twists. This game never gets old. I always come back to the original Candy Crush. Just try to Stop Playing Candy Crush!! I Dare YOU!
Decent game. I find myself getting sucked into it instead of being productive. I do wish that there was a endless type play that you could play that doesn't take lifes.
When you guys automatically change the screen from landscape to portrait screen only? I like the landscape layout better on my tablet.
"This game is fun but once you get to the higher levels, they are impossible to pass without spending money. The game loses its appeal at this point and that's why I'm deleting it."
This game is so cool that I have reached to the the level 200. Although it was hard to reach the highest level it was still fun to play keep it up candy crush.
"It is not a pleasure to play this game. Every level is now an extremingly, nightmaringly hard level and for about 200 retries it is impossible to finish the levdl."
This game is so addicting. I find myself playing for hours upon hours of fun ... I love it. Makes my mind motivate and turn those squeaky mechanical thinking parts. Qà. Awesome!!!
"I love candy crush it definitely helps me relax from a stressful day ,just hates it took me this long to play it's extremely addictive in such a fun way and definitely a stress reliever I get lost for hours playing it 🙃"
"Good game, although sometimes there are levels where it can take forever, pushing you to buy gold, but if you're patient, then it's not necessary."
Gets to a point where you can't continue without spending real money. So many times where there's just 1 left. So dumb. Money grabbing everywhere. Can't escape it
Sometimes there are no way to pass certain levels without paying to get further. Otherwise very nice.
If I play ads to get a life then the game hangs and I have to restart the game. Why on earth is it taking for you so long to fix this bug?
"Love the game completely, it's easier now to pass hard levels because of the ads and boosters. 😄😄"
"I don't like the difficult levels that force you to buy gold bars. Otherwise, the game is fine. Edit: having fun. Interesting at this point."
Its good but some time you just make it stuck up in one level for serval weeks then person get angry no booster nothing i just want that you consider this matter then the gam e will be more intresting.
It says relax and play Candy. But playing hard levels does not feel so relaxing. It just stresses me out. Hope you can fix this.
It was cool. now it just pops up ads all the time. We can no longer use the extra lives. horrible I will uninstall.
"I don't like the constant pop-ups trying to entice me into paying real money for things, but otherwise I enjoy the gameplay."
Love the challenge to mastery. Requires sufficient attention that I can't pursue solutions to real world situations. A real rest from stress.
Only rating it to get the three chocolate things but like it's a rlly fun game and me and my friends play it together as a joke so yea and it's a total classic and gives me nostalgia from when my mom used to play when I was little so yea
Level 471 you're to drop three cherries to the bottom but you have to get them from a dispenser. I spent gold bars three times to get more moves and no fuxking cherries came out for me to even try and drop. Idk it just felt like the game was cheating I lost my win streak that was coming up on 200 wins in a row.
I absolutely 💕 love 😘 this game. It relaxes me enhances my skills as I exceed in levels. It simple and most definitely fun to play. You can also interact with friends when the creator make award winning challenges
"I'm Addictive. It's Addicting. I'm Addicted. S'sweet! S'tasty! S'divine! S'whatelse? S'seratonin kicks in at the vibrating of your device when explosions take place, Level 205 and numerous others will have you screaming at Tiffi in the middle of the night, STOP CRYING! STOP TELLING ME I FAILED! Stop giving me opportunities to buy booster$ & gold bar$ at a dis¢ount, evidently needed to get past some levels, lest you be stuck there for a week! Other than that I'm thoroughly enjoying it."
Makes time pass by but hate spending money on boosters to pass difficult levels. Okay game overall.
"Quite enjoyable and easily addictive. Great way to pass time when you need to! I enjoy all the bonuses you get too, which helps when passing the more difficult levels."
"Kind-of depressing. Aka, definitely not worthy of 3 or more stars. Lol grammah. Chiefly British. Of Scottish origin. Unimportant philosophy of communication. Alternatively, ""The people were bad, and probably will still be until they are naturally removed from sharing pictured man's height."
It's a fun game and relaxing and it actually does does get a little fun to do it that's why I like only reason I gave you the number 417 number 5 or and a half I would have it's just a difficult time. You have and stuff sometimes keeping up can be a little troubling that's not everyone that's just me that's my
"They definitely rigged the game to make you have to purchase packages to pass hard levels. I made at least two purchases in the past month and never received my product. My screen would be stuck on a loading screen, so I would have to force stop the app, then when I open it back up, my purchases aren't there. They claim I received my items when I contacted customer service. I have no reason to lie over my 3 and 5 dollar app purchases, so they obviously need the money more than I do."
This game also became commercial and if we play hard levels and after out of moves if we use boosters it wont be any use of that one and useless to play now and earlier it is good and please remove it from play store
Best game . I really like this game 😊😊😍😍 In this game we find so many challenges and I love challenges. So many levels and rewards also . Chance for daily spin to get rewards. Adds available for rewards. We can play this game with net and without net also. We have five lives in the game. Some levels are very easy but some levels are very difficult and it's hard to solve them but if we keep trying we can solve them. For me this game is fantastic game...
Its a great game keep it up. If you can add some more features were players can chat we each other while playing the game it would be really great.
Good and fun but keep crashing when I purchase the gold during the came. Is this kind of trick to make me fail getting more gold by winning the task? Scam.
This is best because it is challenging game and it's levels are hard to win but it is too challenging and best to play.
"I've noticed the game play to be much more challenging. Then I've noticed that the level I am on, 1969 was 20 moves earlier this year. Now it is 16. Making the game harder so we will buy your boosters? A quick Google and others have noticed too. I don't mind paying to have a more fun experience, I'm an adult and can spend my money however I want. But to not be able to enjoy a game without constant paying to pass troublesome levels? I can choose how to spend my time too."
The new sound effects are terrible. Anti-climactic. The candy crush experience for me just ended. I can't stand the new pop sounds as you clear the board.
After today s update my app is lagging I was on 2220 level and get back to level 1 ..plz recover this ..🙄this is not good it takes so much time i have also a king member and saving my progress.recover my progress and remove this bug
Clear the premium part... We can't collect the gold bars which is necessary for pass the hard level.. Pigy account is under premium... Like this some other necessary things are under the premium.. The game is just for our fun but this premium just took away our fun.. So remove premium otherwise help in other way to collect gold bar...
I'm on a level in the 4000s and almost every single level is impossible to beat unless you buy extra moves.
"Really loved the game... need more events to win goldbars. Edit - I just updated and my champion's race, candy Gold and all my events disappeared. That was trully sad and annoying. Bring back the events, thank you."
"When I finish a level with many turns unused, I should be able to keep the unused turns."
"It was fun. Even spent a few dollars from time to time, but now the question is...... Why am I being forced to play Candy Royale? This will make me delete the game."
"The game is more of a ""cash-grab"" right now than ""funny"". Hard levels have been rigged to force players into spending their money by buying boosters, lives, extra moves. You've deliberately changed how bombs explode by (bombs) creating frost/ ice or whatever you call it and more bombs to make us spend as much cash as possible! (Check level4350 to see whati mean). That's not fair"
"the game is Fun, sometimes challenging and I just love it! I love the sugar stars! I love how the color Bombs explode candies! I also love the relaxing music!"
I don't know what is going on with the game? All of the sudden it tells me I have no internet connection. It's been like this for over a week now and King has done nothing to help me fix the problem even though I have sent email to them. I'm at a loss on how to fix problem and I have done everything as suggested by the help area. Update: I uninstalled app after more than 68 attempt's to contact King. There was no getting past that last level. I even purchased boosters and still couldn't get pas
"This game use to be as advertised, a way to relax & destress & had ads. Now the game has become so stressful that I may stop playing. This is unfortunate since have been playing for years. I was even at the top level just waiting for new levels every Wednesday. Now you took away the ad feature that had boosters & added hard levels that even the video walkthrough will say impossible to pass without boosters. The game should be fair for all instead of for some. Very Sad and disappointing."
"Good but there are some levels that really want you to lose. The last level that I just played made me decide to uninstall the game. First of all, I was literaly about to win the game (the mission is to drop 6 cherries, but we need to drop 1 by 1 in order to make each cherry appears). However, I already DROPPED 5 of them but the last one WONT APPEAR! I had to extend 3 times (using ads, and twice using gold) and it DIDNT APPEAR?! WTV?!"
"When I installed this game after few days, my entire boosters, weekly challenges lost😓 rally bad experience.. my level is 8823 but my badge is 6000! I really want all my boosters"
"I loved this game for years but now I hate it. I miss the old music sounds and graphics, they were absolutely mesmerizing. It's not fun anymore. Too much was changed and it ruined it."
"Still a battery drain (and the phone is new). BUT, the bigger issue is that the game freezes after I pass a level. Kind of annoying, especially if I'm racing to the end and lose my lead because I have to close and reopen the game after every other level 🙄. This has been happening with other King games as well"
The levels are sometimes almost impossible to beat and I do not want to have to spend money on this game and after a recent update that will not let me play the level again without spending money I have to get out of the game and come back later after it's cleared very annoying!! This game is getting more and more annoying they don't care about the people only getting money!! Even with boosters I can't win the level and I'm about ready to delete it!!!
Terrible you can't move on 🤬 you get stuck on the level when you just stay there and stay there and stay there it's a terrible feeling when you can't move on and then you have to ask a friend. How do you past on 🤬 been trying to get past of my level forever
You win if you get lucky. This is not about making the best move. Its about it (the game) letting you pass the level. You're gonna waste your time hoping it lets you win. Better play other real puzzles or strategy games.
"It is great! Only reason I haven't given the full five is that it wins for you, and you don't know why. You have a winning move planned, and.... It gets taken out of your hands and it wins without you. This is confusing and a bit of a downer. But it is otherwise great!"
Very fun game to play if you like to keep your mind busy but the frequent ads and having to pay for everything? I can do without that
"The game is fun, but restricting how long one can play is sad. There are broke people in rehab, on dialysis or hours long infusions or fighting cancer who need the distraction. Why give a bonus for 20 minutes if one can only play for 12 minutes? I Uninstalled it off all of my tech. Not worth it to me."
Prices for booster is too high especially for game. They is no way I'm going to pay over R30 For 15mins at least R0.50c or R1.00 it's reasonable amount. Revise your pricing strategy at lot more people would be able to afford.
The game is good but it isn't relaxing it's stressful. They say swipe away the stress but it's stressful. They minipulate the moves deciding when you win the game with the candy that is droped. Taking away your chance of wining so u can spend money on gold. ITS ROBERY!!!
Relaxing game. I like playng competitively. I really like earning boosters. I like the opportunity to earn moves and boosters by watching advertisements.
i seriously came to loathe this game after it was my favorite i DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN RACES why the hell isn't there an option to opt out of it?????? ALL that there is now is races that you forcefully have to take part in OH and the normal regular levels they used to have ALL turned into the difficult ones for the race btch gtfoh the game that used to relieve stress now causes ×10 the already existing stress. bunch a bs
"For a free stress reliever, this one probably is subpar due to the sheer amount of freaking pop-ups. Even unmonetized ones break the flow and it ends up yanking me out of the groove a little. Still, the animation and sounds are nicer than the other versions in my opinion so I'll take what I can get."
"I did play this game daily, but since the update I'm sorry to say I'm not playing. I don't like the fact you can no longer play in landscape, only portrait."
It's a good app but sometimes you dont give someone the option to watch ads for a reward when needed mostly after depleting all the lives
"Once you spend money on the game, your option to get free stuff by watching ads will be taken away to force you to spend more money."
Enjoying a lot.it helps me to reduce my tension. It gets more exciting to finish the level as the level increases .
Once you get to the levels with the little monster faces you can not win with out using cheat codes. No directions on how to use the monster. Once I hit a monster level I delete the app
I have re-installed this 2 times and lost my game progress both times. Please update my progress so I can play again.
Now This game is not interested because gaming level leaves are very very low.... Please follow up and update the extra moves. Otherwise uninstall the game....
"It's a really fun stress relieving game!!! With hundreds of levels!!!😎 the only thing I don't like is that you have to pay to claim your gold piggy bank ??As well as pay for more lives , and more boosters etc..👍☺️ So good luck"
"game involves little if any skill. most of the boards rely on luck. no surprise: it's designed to entice you to buy boosters. boosters will often ""randomly"" be placed where they don't really help: ergo wasting them. ""random"" in this game is misleading... there's a ""random"" chance assigned by the game at the start of each board. about 1 in 10 of whether you will win that round. if it predecides first that you will not beat the level, nothing you do including boosters will work"
I just paid for items that I did not receive. Usually I don't have any problems but that a total rip off when you pay for things and don't get them. Have the receipt through Google email.
It's an interesting game expect the fact that the moves are less you have 128 cubes to unlock but you only have 22 moves.... The rewards are less at times when you need extra moves rewards aren't given.
"When I started playing this game, I didn't even have a smart phone! I use to play it on Facebook and I loved it, the music was particularly my favorite thing about this game. Now they've changed the music and it's lost all its meaning to me. I can't believe I have to say goodbye to Candy Crush 😔"
Paying to continue levels is stupid. It should be free for all levels as they're played! The attempts are used not by player choice. The game uses the players chances. That's why I won't purchase moved. Its rigged.
"Good game to pass the time with, but unfortunately they just want you to keep spending money all the time to get past the difficult levels & it does add up."
"Fun game, but I wish the fish would go where you need them to go, instead of hitting areas that are not in play. Regardless, this is my favorite game. Woohoo!"
Love the colors and graphics and very challenging. It gives me more challenges than before. I enjoy it more now when it adds more ways too win..
"I love the random gifts & rewards lately. Don't mind purchasing gold bars & other such things to help progress in the game...However I hate after every level I can't just move on to another level because of the back to back pop upS to make a purchase at a discount price, especially when I purchase a power up that only last 30 mins. Overall great game though!!"
I can't advance to the next level because the app doesn't give me the option to view ads to get more moves.
"I was at level 1346 where I have to collect two ingredients, but the two ingredients didn't drop until I went out of move. I've already cleared all the chocolates as well. How am I supposed to pass this level when the ingredients are not given???"
"I have been playing this game for 10years now and i totally love it but recently, it has become very annoying. Firstly the hard levels are just too hard(hard, super hard and night marishly hard) for the love of God, for a game that doesn't have an end in sight, can you take down the hard levels? Or better still give us the option of more moves. I am currently on level 5,298 and i have only 15 moves to crack that level. King, please fix this issue."
"This is really a great game many improvements. PEOPLE WITH Anxiety Issues. This game deserves much-needed REPREVES. It would be appreciated if I could get my refund. THERE ANY WAY I CAN GET MY REFUND? MY IDENTITY WAS STOLEN FROM MY ACCOUNT NEVER GOT YET $300.00 WAS IN ANOTHER STATE AND CANCER HOSPITAL. GRANDMOTHER RAISING 2 GRANDSONS. PLEASE RESPOND ASAP. HAVE WROTE IN MANY TIMES WITH COPIES OF EVERYTHING BUT NO RESPONSE. HAD TO CHANGE PHONES, NUMBER AND SO MUCH MORE. ATTENTION NEEDED. VEE...."
It is an amazing game i am addicted to it hard after 2000 it's very thrilling may some might not like because it for small kids but it's really really nice go for it but 1 problem if we struck in one level it's give any ad or mountain claims its very boring when we struck it's going on for 3-4 days
Horrible update version 1.248.0.1 due to candy crush is restricted us to play saved life's. Ridiculous update version. I hate it. I don't want to play any more this game.
*NEW* I was PISSED y'all got rid of Rewards UNTIL I saw the new layout and ALL the ways to get goodies within the game! Excellent work guys thank y'all! Hopefully 2023 won't end in me spending hundreds on this addictive yet fantastic game like I did last year! I LOVE Lemonade Lake! They fixed any issues I had previously and it's playing great!
This game is so addictive. I only have trouble sometimes when claiming rewards after watching ads.
1: Having FUN 2: Still having fun 3: 3/11/23 having alit of fun. When i played ir like in 2015 i dont think it was this fun. Seemed more frustrating or difficult to level up. So thanks for the additions since them its keeping me much more interested.
"Store never connects when needed. Terrible management. I'm willing to spend money on the app, but store doesn't connect."
I'm facing glitches in the app from past few weeks... Whenever I watch ad for extra moves the app gets closed automatically!! Very upset by this
I liked candy crush because of its old music.but this new version doesn't have that music anymore. I m going to uninstall this now. It's the music which used to sooth my mind while playing and it used to make us feel like a child.
Excellent game to play. Feeling relax after completing every stage. But some stages are not complete without buying and are almost impossible to pass.
"I used to love this game but having to buy boosters every time I hit a new level is ridiculous. Also, I have gold bars, but can't use them because it never ""connects"" to the ""store"". I have been playing for years. But recently quit because it's not fun and had WAAAYYY too many pop ups between lives or levels. I don't want to race people for gold bars I can't use anyways. I don't want to buy boosters. I do t care who played the most levels this week... etc. Just let.me play levels and relax!"
"It's good, better then 10 years ago when I last played it but the trail isn't as interesting looking as it used to be. Overall 4 stars"
After update game slow. And interface reduced and colour bomb not getting in new level. Overall Candy crush gone to Crushed out.
"This game is a challenging,fun great for the brain game and the colors are bright easy shapes to match up for the best chain reaction you ever seen"
Since the start of 2023 King have removed the ability to watch ads to get free boosters and extra moves at the end of levels meaning I'm stuck on levels for weeks at a time. Obviously to many people are buying moves so that king don't need to earn revenue from adverts.
Some levels are just not possible to beat without buying extra moves over and over again. They're impossible. I'm on a level with 120 jelly to clear and I have 13 moves to clear that.
Man I got a new phone that had candy crush already installed. I quit playing due to the fact they push you to purchase. But I figured I'd give it a go and it's worse than before. Greedy greedy company. Uninstalled and download royal match. Much better and more fun!
"I love the game, but it cheats all the time, I think you need to watch x amount of adds before you can complete the level. Swipe one way and it goes the over that just for starters."
"Really nice game and it can be played off and online , not slow when playing but some levels seem too hard mostly when offline with out no extra chances to continue (when offline) it seems boring to play."
Awesome game ever and deserve for 5 star rate❤❤❤❤ I've been playing with my little Shan2 and endeed we enjoy it very much and learned alot of things such as patience and decision making how to move exactly. That's why we really enjoy playing this game so much. And hope you guys having fun with it and download this app if you don't have it.. this is very relaxing and highly recommended for everyone.😍😍 Pls respect my grammar. 😞
The new update is absolutely horrible. It will not let me exit the buying screen after I lose a level. The boosters dissappear and don't do what they are supposed to. Sometimes I match to make a booster and it doesn't even produce the booster I just created. The only way to pass levels is gold bars for extra moves unless you play the same level like 800 times till you get lucky. What a joke this game has morphed into
Amazing game!! It can get hard though at some points and can take hours as your life's run out after 5 attempts
"Can you imagine, play the game for more than 2 years everyday with out stopping,and you want to check in your account to save you progress then suddenly all your progress disappear and return from the first, will that's me because of the son of bit... Game. Don't download it This is my advice"
Whatever process selected my team for gold pin team during new challenge truly lacks excellence. I HAVE A DEADBEAT PLAYER WHO FOR TWO DAYS HAS ZEROOO PARTICIPATION. Thanks for your best? Nancy Carol Ragle.
"Its really a relaxing game.The highlight of this game is that without internet you can play,so the network issue wont bother you,anytime anywhere you can access this game,personally,I really enjoy this game during my leisure time. Thanking you for providing such interesting and simple game.Thanks a lot"
"PAY TO WIN. Edited to remove 1 star because of the pattern: deliberately dont give enough moves, to trick you into spending money. Similar to all these other negative reviews, the problem is the shortsighted and poorly thought out difficulty curve."
Horrible!! Game cheats you out of the wins!! Does what it wants to to do mess your chance to win. Dump money into it you can almost guarantee a win every single round but don't dump a cent in and it will screw you over!!!! Don't download waste of life!!!!!
Good game to get the stress levels up when you lose a level and you only need one more move lol. But good fun
"No ads, good way to keep your brain functioning quickly, unless you are too young and lazy, like my kids!"
Hello this game is so relaxing I'm in level 5thousand up but I notice that if you're playing the the cotton climb to get extra booster they will not appear all the booster you win it. Only 1 booster appear. Hope u can fix it. Now I give 3 star. Thank u
I love this game it lets my stress away. And there's no problem at all regarding the levels. It goes on very well and it's fun as well.
"It's a very vibey game, keeps time going. Though some levels are quite challenging but to a certain extent they're a repetition series"
"They want us to pay and hv removed the option for getting additional lives, also no ""frnds"" donate any lives anyway aftr this update. It's better y'all fix this cause this game is getting stressful which is quite the opposite of what it's supposed to do. Or else it's your loss, me and PPL like me will stop playing this game."
"Not fun. It's not a game of skill or chance, you won't advance until the game let's you and it will keep you stuck for potentially days. For example, there are challenges where you need to collect licorice swirls, but the game doesn't spawn them for you to collect regularly. You are just going to stay on that level until thr computer decides to offer them to you. You are able to do most levels on the first try, but you will spend most time on the hard ones proportionately. Not fun after a while."
I am so UNHAPPY with candy crush you changed the format to portrait mode only. .!!!! It makes it smaller and makes it harder to see i uninstalled it.! Very bad move!
"This app is getting useless,u cheat ur player a lot now,I was playing a nightmarishly hard level and I bought lives to complete it and u people brought a useless ads I ignore the ads and u restart the app ,,how,u wasted my 10goldbars,this hurt me so much"
One star. I recently discovered it is possible to lose a level in one move (the only possible move in this specific level) because you run out of possible matches to make and instead of the game treating this like it's the game's fault and not taking your lives it takes a life and ruins your streak because the level wasn't set up correctly. It at least shouldn't take a life if you still have moves left
"Game deliberately switches the move your going to make to clear the level, so for example you will be making a move to create a stripe candy but will make out you switched something else. Con of a game."
"Why there's no ads now? I need that for extra moves, lives and gifts so I can finish the level easily. Hope to be back soon. Thanks"
"I normally love this game, but the new update sucks. I have to restart the app to get the ad to go away. After every loss it gets a little annoying. Heaven forbid you're stuck on a level. You could be restarting the game numerous times on the same level and then it's almost becoming not worth it. Fix this quickly..."
"Nice game, it's great to play, but I got disappointed when the hard levels are practically impossible to pass without paying or buying golds, and for people like me, the golds are too expensive, having to buy every level it makes no sense! It would be great if it was a strategy game, but no, it has nothing to do with strategy, it's a pay to win! It's true they help you at times, but I've been playing the same level for two weeks, and nothing! I DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
Very fun!!! My fiance and I have races to see who can get to the highest board within a certain amount of days. I am still enjoying this game!!
"Too many Temu ads! Way too many and they're lengthy. They're irritating. I don't know how much advertisers pay to have an ad up, but good lord! Can you at least change the ads to something that doesn't make me want to throw my phone out the window? (I still love Candy Crush)"
Fun game to pass time but if you have things to do don't start playing until you have finished it because this game is addictive and you won't be able to put it down.
Made a purchase and never got my gold. I sent in a support ticket and they said this happens when switching devices. I never did switch devices Had literally just bought it and got no credit. I sent in proof and was ignored. They stole my money and I can't get any further. I won't buy anything again.
Just so relaxing helps with my emotions just love the game. You can't put the game it's very challenging and fun my Grandchildren love candy crush they have a lot of fun. But during 2020 Middle June during Our 1stbLockdoen I Was Diagnosed With Pancreatic Cancer Had Whipple Surgery October 6th then On 4th December I Started Chemo. This has been a very difficult time but thanks to Candy Crush This Amazing Game has changed for the better there are less adds thankyou more relaxing as well.
This should've been a relaxing game. It is pay to win. I just Uninstaller the game after a week on the same stage. If you don't keep pumping money you just waste your nerves on the same stage and keep closing numerous offers to buy to pass the stage. Very disappointed
"Game keeps freezing as soon as an ad to buy power ups, pops up. Can't click out of it in any way, but yet, if I click on buy now, it magically disappears! The same ad, every single time. So I have to exit out of the whole game, and reopen, just for it to happen again and again. You're not getting my money, so forget it."
"Like what is happening with this game, this is the second I'm making a complaint here. The game keeps crashing and blackout anytime I start a level, I won't even be able to play and then when it blacks out my game lives removes and I didn't even get to play and it became worse when I updated it, it won't even open it just blacks out directly. I actually stopped playing for a while thinking it will be better buh no it's not at all😠😠 and it's really annoying...."
"I am very disappointed with this game. I deleted it... and restarted it on my phone. I always have to start again, loosing my heart. It sticks all the time 😥😥😥 i also have it on my fire Tab... but I can't get any ads."
"Fantastic game,I love it but I like it to have some cash rewards for the players, because of the time it was used in playing the game, There's no disturbing ad on the game app,applus for the creator. thanks"
"I still have had some problems but some things have greatly improved. I really enjoy this game and Candy Crush Soda, Do you accept Google Play Points???💙I really want to give these games 5 star's but once again the game gets me. It either takes my boosters or grab a few moves I've got left. 💯"
"Had to delete the app because the candy crush ads were ruining other games I play. Every time I played a game with a candy crush adverts, no matter how careful you are you can't close the app and takes you straight to app instead. Can't go back or stop this and it closes the game I was originally playing which means I need to reload over and over because of the candy crush ad."
There's no point playing this game anymore. It takes several tens of taps to hide all the pointless in-game ads to sell in game currency before you even get to the game
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!!!!The worst game ever. These updates are the worst. I've been playing this game before. Reached lvl 1800+ when I took a break. I came back to it because I missed it but bruh... I've been stuck at level 230 for over a week now. ONE FULL WEEK???? . there's no way you can move to the next level unless you use buffs non stop. I will not pay you a penny !!!! . If you read this. Trust me . DO NOT PAY FOR THIS . THEIR PLAN IS TO BUY MORE AND MORE
"Very well instructed and happy to receive praise all the time, really good game! Very addictive to play as you want to pass the next levels! You need to have patience and timing skills too! A game that you must play!"
"Love the game but I don't get freebies on my Android, like watching a short video to get rewards, very frustrating as my friends all get on Candy Crush Saga"
I don't get the option to watch adds to earn more lives or other stuff. Some levels are extremely hard and I feel like you should have more lives than what they give you to complete them.
"Lol the game has gotten harder,it isn't fun to play anymore,they are literally the ones that decides if you fail or win,once you lose a level more that 5 times then they'll make it very easy for you to win by matching the candies for you to get stripped candies so you can win easier 😂"
"What a game this is. Can't stop playing. But the only bad thing is that levels after 100 spam hard levels. Also, can you add a new setting? To get the old music back? This doesn't bother me too much though, because, unlike some people, this game is still what it is, candy crush, the legendary game and it's unique Candy's ability's, and my favourite candy, the fish!"
"It's fun to play at the beginning. But then as you get to higher level (am at 1700ish) it just gets too hard to pass a level, it's no longer fun. Don't know where all the free daily booster we used to get. I am now stuck at very tough level and limited booster. The competition against other players is also not fair. We compete to finish an episode the fastest or to have as many level passed in a week, but we don't know the levels of our competitors are playing."
"Exceptional can't stop playing, the higher the level the harder it gets. Great"
It seems like you could get through the stages faster as well more booster during the game. Ads are fine with me gives me time to refocus
"Best time pass game 😂...... It will not be boring, it will be fun, it will be interesting 😅....... Hope you like it 🥰..... Can be played both online and offline 🙂 ... No ad breaks....... Free and Purchase can be played in both ways ...... Download now if you want to play ...... thank you ........🙏💙"
"I play this game (of thrones) to win, my competitiveness keeps me from getting frustrated with the impossible challenges. To all the cry babies crying over Candy Crush don't do this or give me that...Stop crying...and enjoy the sweetness of going the next level...I never get stuck on a board...."
"Update. Glitches were fixed quickly. This week's update, however, causes an ad to come up on level failure. Unable to X out of. I have to close the app and reopen it. Great game. Today's update has caused some serious graphics glitches on my Pixel 6 Pro though. Very unusual for you guys. Hopefully you can find a quick fix."
Such a nice game I would have given it 5 stars if there was a way to get more combos without paying for it with real cash but still a very nice game👍🏽
"My best game at escaping boredom, but now gold is disappearing,I have over 100gold,but now just 2 without using it, that's not good, second time this will happen pls look into this"
I feel like I spend more time declining things to pay for than playing the actual game. King games are becoming a scam.
"Experience is good,but I preferred the old sound. Recently you have changed the sound, and I don't like it. Please return to the old nice songs😭"
"Candy crush to me is perfect but all there need to do for me is the life timing. I love the game not bad at all great in taste so you need to fix is more for the people to love it more like putting some chatting to the challenge, you see that to me you know what to do. Not been in here before this my first time"
"How to I keep old levels on a new phone. My old phone got water in it and it's never switched on again but I had been playing a few games for years and when I installed one game and went to play it I had to start from the beginning again which means I've lost years of playing the game and lots of money as I use to buy things in game, their has to be a way of keeping your old games on a new device. As old phone won't turn on I cant transfer anything to new phone. I'd be really greatful for help"
I have being playing this game myself for quite some time when my children started joining me. We all find much exciting. I find much relaxing after day's busy at work. At times it sounds silly and clumsy when an adult playing such unprecedented game of no value. I remember my Chief Excecutive Officer asked me how I need to relax after long busy day. Such game helps restore full energy of an adult so always play such games. Need to add few more moves to break all the blocks for easy win. Cheers
Great mind challenging but how to play & rules need to be explained in detail upfront. Also more to read pop-up info.
"Very refreshing, but the super hard and nightmarish games are too difficult to complete. Please do something about it."
"Pretty good app, many repetitive ads but at least you receive bonus items to beat next level."
"The app mistakenly got deleted and I download it again but can't retrieve my progress even after putting my email and password and I'm at 3000 level, I can't start again, it's discouraging."
"I have played for years, but this latest update forces you to play with your phone upright. If your phone is larger, this is severely uncomfortable in the long run, and I might actually uninstall the game because of this."
"Complete Scam; Click Bait Ads that don't give a reward for wasting 30 seconds watching some shady advertisement try and convince you it's legitimate. King has clearly sold out. Want more lives? Too bad, you have to wait for 24hrs to use the 200+ FREE lives your friends send you, but instead you can try to sit through 30seconds of TEMU funded garbage only to not even be able to click the reward button. It is a shame king has morphed into a shady click bait entity. My how the mighty have fallen."
"Decided to update my review since improvements have been made which is great. Been playing candy crush for 10 years,I can't believe it has been that long. Time is flying. One thing I've noticed I will not give up on a level until I've completed it like I will not put the phone down unless I've passed. I've spent over a week on a particular level but felt great victory once I completed it. Is there a way we can see how long it takes us to personally pass a level we're on?"
It's definitely set up for you to be on a won streak and then lose easy ones to keep you hooked!
"Over level 2000 it's not fun. 15 moves are not enough unless you buy. Even if you have boosters, the game will still end up the same. Not paying to play. You'd think they've got to be millionaires with all the ads and players who are willing to pay."
"Recent update problem! Since this latest update the game has been continually freezing up when I do not pass a level. It freezes up on a screen offering in-game purchase for additional ""lives"" & ""boosters"" and doesn't allow me to close out that pop-up. At which point, my only option to continue is to go to my phone settings and ""force stop"" of the app. Once I have restarted the game, all of my ""additional lives"", ""gold bars"" and ""boosters"" that I've accumulated disappear. Fix this ASAP please."
"Lost a whole days progress, sent back 20+ levels... Don't tell me about being logged in to save progress... You won't get another cent off me if you can cheat your customers like that."
Thank you for Wonderful AWESOME Addictive Game!!! Having Great Fun My Granddaughter and myself having a Great Fun😊 This Game is Awesome and So Much FUN. Awesome Game I can only say Terrific!!! All I Can Say Fun Fun Fun!!! ALL I can SAY IT'S GREAT RELAXATION!!! VERY ENJOYABLE!!! Having Great Fun. Having GREAT FUN 👍Words Can't describe how Addictive this Game IS 😍 Awesome FUN After Stressful Day from Work! Awesome 👌
"This game has the potential to actually really be fun, but I find it difficult to enjoy when it doesn't follow the rules it sets... A candy being matched when there are no candies of the same near it and no reason for it to trigger. Having 3 turns available and when I make a move, somehow it goes from 3 available to none in a single turn. Not enjoyable when the game does that."
"Ad,s are not available for this game ,the are help me to get rewards for passing the hard levels, pls gave ads to my game. Ireally enjoy the game.pls give ads for rewards,it's helps us to pass the hard levels and also few more reward options are not come in my game like color bombs , another rewarding games etc are not come in my game. Pls tell me these are available are not available in this game."
Yo it's a really good game ! it keeps your mind focused and off alot of things it's very helpful 100% Recommend ! have a good day!🫶🏽
Will not allow me to use lives sent to me by friends. When I select lives it will show that I can use it but will not let me use it and dissappears from my mailbox and it is lost. The help site did not help or return any of my lives. Guess I'm done with this game.
"What is wrong with this Game?? Since the last Update it has developed a few Issues, Issue one when i fail a Level and it offers more Gold Bars if i press the cross it won't go away even if i do purchase the Gold Bars, Issue two it is constantly freezing at the end of the Levels and i have to keep switching my phone off and back on again to make the Game work and then it does it again, sort this out or this normally good Game will be deleted it was okay before the update now its a load of Junk."
Good game excellent graphics fun addicting I'm probably I'm in love with 200 gets harder to obviously bob you go how you go the more I get a hold of it yeah go ahead definitely get this just great
I don't like how long it takes to finish the level after completing... Like can I fastfoward through the left over turns turning into candies?
"I give this game app 2 stars cus in as much as the game is super fun, because of the colors bursts and all, I still believe it's a difficult game sometimes, some of the levels are too hard to pass, I go a month without opening the app when I'm stuck in a level, the number of moves are very limited on the nightmarishly hard levels"
"Now it has become very irritating because when you get stuck at some level, it takes more than a week, still it is not cleared."
It's very good it keeps you away from stress. You look forward for life to refill and play again.💜
"Absolutely awful game. I spent some of my Google play credit to buy some gold bars, and somehow, by doing that, it null and voids every ""special"" or opportunity to complete the levels. My family are able to complete the levels by watching 3 videos.. I don't even have the option.. Absolute JOKE! Uninstall."
"Watch 6 ads and still lose level ???? Waste of time! DIG THIS is a much better game! The more I play candy crush, the more I despise it.😡 With every update, the user loses more rewards. It prompts you to purchase if you ""get stuck"" on a level, so DEVELOPER KNOWS players get ""stuck!"" Wants you to keep watching more ads (💰 for developer) for less rewards. Destroys matches you have made, when it shouldn't, so that you will watch more ads. You ONLY win, when the game allows you to win."
I Almost Always have a good time when I play day or night just frustrating when I run outta lives and has to be hooked to Facebook or wait for lives til someone logs in if you have friends 🤨🙄 👍🏽 But I LIKE IT 😉
"Too many ads !when ever I play a game and I start the level and boom ! An ad from candy crush . Worst game ever. Even after I downloaded it,it was still giving ads."
I love the Events tab because it provides multiple chances to win different boosters. I also enjoy the new candies that are added at different levels. Some levels are very difficult but if you use boosters then you can win and progress to the next level. Plus there have great deals on the Shop tab if you want to buy more boosters and other items.
"Frustrating. I played this game for 3 years before taking a break because the levels were becoming impossible to beat. I'm sad to say that it's still that way. I've played now for 3 days and passed 2 levels. Only way to pass is to play the same level for days or buy a power up. Boring and frustrating. It used to be a fun game, now it's unreasonably hard. I'm done for good."
I'm having the best time playing this game and it helps my mind to refresh and think fast. It's the best and I love this game and I'm truly grateful to the creater ❤️🥳. I'll continue playing this game. I highly encourage everyone to try this game and I promise you will never regret it ever
Might as well see really given anybody any money most people can't go to London to play it's almost like a scam uninstall you should have made it with anybody participating win money instead of rigging it like that
Now I'm not getting watch ads helps extra move and lives it's suddenly stopped !!!! how can i solve this issue ?!
"I used to ply it before, so I downloaded it again. But now it's radically different: many levels are impossible to pass unless you watch 3-4 adds. I get that when the product is ""free"" one must somehow get revenue. But for Candy Crush - this is taken to extreme. Way too greedy!"
"I wish it didn't require purchases in order to complete difficult levels. Otherwise, it's a fun game."
"It's so amazing,😊, but I'm giving it 4 stars because the rewards in gold are small, at least make 100 for leader"
The recent update got rid of all my gameplay even Wen I try to reconnect/login in through FB. nothin or reconnect. Wen it loads only on lv 2
It's just not fun anymore. The levels are so complicated It's no longer fun. There are never enough turns to get through a level and sometimes it takes a month or more to pass a level. And something is glitching. My boosters are not showing up even after an update. Just empty circles. Figure it out!!
Great game to keep you entertained. However disappointing when the video's glitch and shut down the app.
Game is addicting!! I hate when I run out of lives while I'm passing through levels like a pro....some levels look impossible. But keep playing and you will eventually pass it.. GOODLUCK EVERYONE!!
"Not much fun anymore very frustrating spending too much time completing levels, they are becoming less of skill and more of stopping you from completing the levels, having to watch far too many Video Adverts to eventually complete the levels sadly. It's a regular occurance, not enough moves to finish hard levels to try to get you to buy boosters 😡😡😡very boring being stuck on a level that are impossible to complete, read and listen to your reviews"
"The game is very very interesting but it just doing anyhow recently after watching ads, it's starts all over again and my candy royale progress will be lost . Please do something about it"
"After the update, I am unable to use my gold bricks in order to continue the level. It keeps saying connecting server 😔"
I love all the Candy Crush games. But why do I have to click through 14 trillion pop-ups every time I open the app??? SO ANNOYING!!!
This is good for brain breaks and passing time. I usually choose this over most other apps although lately the app has been crashing mid play or right as I finish a level and always during a time when I have a streak so when it crashes I will lose all my progress and have to start all over. I give it 3 stars for this reason.
Great game but I wish we had the daily treat calendar. Please can we have dogs or any animals to choose has friends. Thank you
"I am glad it is not the distressed king, that's too much. This is big fun. When lines happen in my favor by seemingly no fault of my own, I feel it's going to be a Sweet Day!"
Having great fun without spending a lot of money. I need to find an explanation of the boosters and symbols used in the game. Not sure where to find it.
"Gets very difficult by level 200+ ... It's as if the owner of the app doesn't want anyone to win. If that's the case then it would be better if you just deactivate all candy crush apps. You think we're very happy with your games? No. We don't have a choice because it's the only thing we can access easily in this app store. At least make your players comfortable with different levels. I really hate it after 30 times coming back to same level, I can't pass tru because of insufficient assistance."
"The game kept freezing on a pop up to buy boosters for $3.99. I couldn't click out of it because it seemed like it froze. When I clicked on the button to buy, it miraculously unfroze. I had to Uninstall and then reinstall. In doing so I lost my 50+ extra lives and all my boosters. And now I'm stuck on a ridiculously hard level. Makes me want to stop playing. UPDATE: Apparently I lost all of my extra lives and boosters for nothing. The game is still freezing 😡"
"Negative stars if I could, get to a level nightmare hard, use all boosts multiple times with impossible odds and same progress using no power ups. Games are supposed to be fun, not blow all lives stressing out 2-3 times a day losing hard earned boosters. Game is definitely and intelligently rigged. Is attractive to start but more stress than fun as it goes. If you have money to waste then go for it but this game is little to no fun for F2P"
"The best game I've ever played. So challenging but interesting. I'm only dissatisfied by the latest update where you've limited the number of lives from friends I can accept per day. This decision is too harsh and unfair. Actually it makes the game so boring, look I can can get stuck on a level for about a week. Remember there's a limited number of lives every after 30 mins interval I get one life. Now the only possible way to get extra lives is to ask for help from friends."
